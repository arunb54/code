0,"Useful once you want cloud and some toher stuuf, but lacks any help in getting started",1
1,Any price is too high for Microsoft Office,1
2,Amazon suggested this item when I bought a new ASUS,0
3,"Only problem, this is 32-bit and the ASUS is 64-bit",-1
4,"I had to return it and now won't benefit from adding it on to the comp, thus reducing the price",-1
5,"Thanks for nothing, Amazon (and Microsoft for being difficult; seriously, Windows 10 is the worst)",-1
6,perfect,1
7,"The product didn't work I had to call Microsoft  and they installed for me and it cost 400 something dollars so I can amazon sell it for cheaper unless the product is fake and people are begin con out of there money, rating sucky",-1
8,Wish the licence would last longer than just one year,-1
9,$100 every year seems a bit ridiculous considering a few years ago you could get Office 2010 Home for around $120 (though that only included a licence for a single PC),-1
10,Installation was more difficult than it needed to be,-1
11,Further problems with Microsoft 365 Word,-1
12,Do not try to write macros,-1
13,Macros in earlier versions of Word work fine,-1
14,"For some reason macros for earlier versions do not work, and if you write a macro that has anything to do with Find/Replace, it will not behave in a similar fashion to earlier versions",-1
15,"This is partly because the people who designed 365 assume users of no particular skill, who are content to use Word just the way it comes out of the box",-1
16,"In other words, Word 365 is more automated, less kindly about those who want to tailor it to do specialized functions",1
17,I'm sure that people who are conversant in Visual Basic will have better luck,0
18,"I am not, and will go back to an earlier version of Word (Everything up to 2010 worked perfectly",-1
19,")

Again (check below for more), there is little I can discover in Word 365 that warrants a subscription",-1
20,"That you are renting it year by year, from my point of view, is just another Microsoft scam",-1
21,I would strongly recommend anyone who has used earlier versions of Office (probably up to 2007 for PC) to stick with the older versions,-1
22,"Although I am still in the free trial period, I find Office 365 Word the most bloated, difficult to use, counterintuitive program of any writing program I have ever used",-1
23,"I think what the designers had in mind was the ultimate ""automated"" program possible--imagine a car with swerve control, automatic parallel parking, object detection, automatic braking",-1
24,That is what 365 Word is,0
25,The ribbon by itself hoards the screen,0
26,"Though retractable, you will not easily be very productive as you will be spending most of your time searching for the functions that, as far as I know were available in the classic menu in the version previous to 2010",0
27,The program is so fully automated that it is human proof,0
28,"There might be workarounds, but I have as of yet been able to work with its newly designed ""styles"" which they splash across the screen as if, writing were nothing more than prettifying your page",0
29,"My sense is that the programmers are ""peachy proud"" of all the new features they have built into this mayhem",-1
30,"You can, of course, after you pay Microsoft for your annual prescription, buy downloadable ""classic menu"" software--that too will cost you, and then, you can buy book, reference books that you can read late into the night",0
31,My question would be why would anyone put money out for a program that is as difficult as learning a new language,-1
32,And why would a user of  Word all the way back to the '97 version have to dedicated so very much time to relearning what is meant to perform the simple function of writing,0
33,Perhaps you have the time,0
34,I'm going back to the 2003 version,-1
35,"I have since added the classical menu, courtesy of [",0
36,"] I am still in the 15 day free trial period, but the classical drop-down menu does improve the ease of use of Word 365",1
37,The Classical Menu software even has a couple of functions that are not listed in the ribbon menu,1
38,I have updated my rating for 365 to two stars,-1
39,Still a difficult program for us long time users who used to enjoy the transparency of the older versions,-1
42,"Again, I would warn the user of earlier versions to expect the unexpected",0
43,"Since I last updated this review, two strange factors  have occurred",-1
44,"First, Word 365 stripped out macros I wrote in my desktop (I followed instructions, went to options/trust/and enabled all macros)",-1
45,It worked on my laptop but not my desktop,-1
46,"Second, for reasons unknown to me, suddenly Word 365 started saving my docx in 365 format and not 93-97",-1
47,"More strange, if you go to your folders from 365, it won't show anything but your 365 formats",-1
48,This is not true if you go to your microsoft windows view,-1
49,"Also, I wish to note, that Word, if like me, you have Windows 7 and only 8 gig ram, 365 programs are as slow as molasses in Vermont in the dead of winter",-1
50,Adding to its slowness is a splash page inbetween what used to be the relatively simple operation of saving your file,-1
51,"First you have to go to a file screen, then to save or save as or browse, or, etc",0
52,"The file splash screen is  more aesthetic than functional and again shows the programmers of 365 to be more interested in ""pretty"" over ""efficient",1
53,"""
I do not think overpriced 365 will last",0
54,"Libra Office, which I had thought lacked a decent outline format (like Word) now has one, and even an add-on program, Organum",0
55,I am  probably trying the patience of anyone who wants to take in a simple thumbs up or thumbs down,0
56,"Another defect I discovered in Office Word 365 is that there is no option to create a backup copy of your documents with a ""save",-1
57,""" You can use Options, Advanced to save a backup copy, but it saves your file in the ""Roaming"" folder (if your hard drive goes, your backup goes)",1
58,"Of course, you can use the Cloud, but that too is a separate operation",-1
59,"As with the Classic Menus, you have to buy a special software program if you want to streamline your save procedure",-1
60,This is the deal Microsoft made with the devil,-1
61,Pay us the subscription cost for our bloated program,0
62,"If you want our program to work for you, well, you''ll have to buy add-on programs",0
63,"Code was invalid per Microsoft, Amazon is refunding because they do not have replacement in stock",-1
64,The extra cloud storage makes this worth the purchase,1
65,"Kinda bummed though that you know have to ""lease"" Office from year to year",0
66,Now I have a yearly update I have to buy or they turn it off,0
67,"Would be great for a buisness but for personal use on home computers just to much
to expect a yearly fee",2
68,Fast and as described,1
69,It was easy to load but i thought it was for a year,2
70,Once it got here it said 6 months,0
71,The sticker on this product did not come off the package and it was useless,-1
72,I had my IT guy install all the software on our new Surface Pro 4s so I can't speak to that,0
73,The conversion of old files was easy for me,0
74,I don't know how the $$$costs will compare when the first year license expires,0
75,This will be our first experience with not using the same version of Office for 4 or more years between upgrades,0
77,I don't think it is much better than Office 2007,-1
78,"In some ways, it isn't better",-1
79,"Worked great, saved $20, will buy again",1
80,A good deal for the five PCs I've loaded it on,1
81,I'm using more of the features and enjoying them more,1
82,Love the light weight and overall sleek look as well as the screen,1
83,The processing speed is average,0
84,The chief complaint is the location of the power button - I constantly hit it accidentally when trying to hit delete,0
85,Maybe the keyboard layout is to meant to imitate MacBooks but it is super annoying,-1
86,Would recommend designing a power button that needs more force to press down or just place it elsewhere on the machine,0
87,Also not a fan of the Mac style mouse pad,-1
88,would rather have actual right and left mouse buttons but getting used to it,0
89,This was a great deal and keeps Microsoft from auto deducting payment from my accounts,1
90,Best deal in software all around,1
91,I like the price and it arrived quickly,1
92,"was recommended to purchase with a chrome book, not compatible with chrome book",2
93,The software is great,1
94,Works great,1
95,Worked like a charm,1
96,Works great,1
97,Perfect and great value,1
98,I would recommend this seller,1
99,When I tried to install the program I was told there was a problem,-1
100,"I cannot remember what it exactly was, so I called the installation support number on the back of the card",0
102,After he had worked for some time trying to install Office 365 he informed me that I had some malware (Zeus) on my computer which was the reason that Office 365 could not be installed,0
103,"He told me that someone else in his company could fix the problem, he would transfer me",0
104,The next technician (American?) said he could fix it but this would cost money which I had expected,-1
105,He offered me a yearly service contract for $150,0
108,He tried to talk me into a multi year contract which I refused,0
109,When I attempted to pay with my credit card the charge was refused by the bank,0
110,The same result with my second credit card,0
111,"The technician told me I should call my bank ""but not tell them it was for a computer company""",0
112,"The charge finally was accepted and he started  working on my computer which I could follow, though not understand, on my monitor",0
113,After about three hours of activity the first  technician called and told me that everything worked now and Office 365 was installed,0
114,So far so good,1
115,Next day I got the invoice from SINGH TECH for $170,0
116,A few hours later I received an e-mail with a fraud alert from my second credit card that they had denied a suspicious charge of $170,0
118,I have only received a customer code and a telephone number from the first technician,0
119,"My computer, after I upgraded to Win 10, started freezing up occasionally ( about once a day), a nuisance but since it was rare I accepted it",-1
120,"The equipment is some years old, it still works but I cannot get drivers for Win 10 anymore",2
121,"Now, after the installation of Office 365 and the ""removal of malware""  it freezes up several times a day",-1
122,I have to do a hard shut-down with the power button and  a start to get it going again,0
123,"The Office 365, at least what I have used so far, seems to be working ok",1
124,"I tried to Google SING TECH (in Baltimore as per their e-mail invoice) which was not so easy to find; what I found were a few web sites asking if the company was ""legit or a fraud"", another one complaining about  having been told he had a virus etc",0
125,Right now I'm utterly confused,0
126,I have not called them but will do soon,0
127,"Saved $20 bucks, if you want to renew the then this is an excellent option",1
128,I use office 365 daily and I find the cost worth it when you factor in the online storage,1
129,The reason for only 4 stars is that you can use this code to extend an online subscription if you have a credit card  setup for payment and your account is past due,0
130,Our CC for my subscription was no longer valid and our O365 account became past due,0
131,I bought this card to extend the subscription and to save $25,0
132,I'm his did not work and about an hour of time with Office support led me to fixing the account by paying for the service and having the past due removed,0
133,"Once that was done I was able to add the card, and now my account is paid up for two years",0
134,It will be even better after I explore all its features!,0
135,"awkward, poor support",-1
136,$80 per year for 5 always up to date copies of the full MS Office suite and 5 Terabytes of cloud space?  How can you go wrong?  I recommend it to everyone,-1
137,I love how easy it all is,1
138,Trying the subscription method for the first time,0
139,Seems advantageous since I have multiple devices to download the software,1
140,"So instead of spending a $1000, I spend only about $90",0
141,"Hopefully, it will work out well",0
142,"Almost like buying or leasing a car; if leasing, at the end of the day I won't have a product to show for the money I spent but will continue to get new updated versions",2
143,"If buying, I won't have payments after the last but will still have the product",0
144,We'll see,0
145,The software is fine except for one item,2
146,"There is a question that asks if I would like to protect everything, if you choose ""yes"", it holds your opening default page hostage and Norton's page comes up",0
147,Didn't like that,-1
148,Had to google the information to turn off that feature,0
149,"Other than that, MS Office is a great software, until they change it again",2
150,I've installed on two PCs,0
151,Flawless installs,1
152,"Arrived on time, great price",1
153,"I remember when Office was installed on all computers, but now you have to pay out the wazoo for it",0
154,I bought the year subscription and am pleased with the product,1
155,"They send you a card that allows you up to 5 PCs, laptops, tablets, etc",0
156,"You get all the Office products: Word, Excel, Publisher, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, etc",0
157,This is well worth the subscription,1
158,It also works on MAC computers,1
159,I would recommend this product,1
160,"What can I say, it's MS office",1
161,Dependable product,1
162,Always a good program the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 it because you have to renew it each year now rather than just keep using the old version,2
163,Good value,1
164,I had trouble uploading it on one of my laptops,-1
165,I didn't need to buy it in the 1st place as the notice to renew was bogus,-1
166,Always liked Office Products,1
167,Expensive for a retiree but worth it for everything I do,2
168,Followed the instructions that came with key card and had no problems with installation,0
169,Plus it was much cheaper to buy a new subscription than to renew through Microsoft,1
170,Glad I switched to the Office 365 annual subscription service,1
171,At less than $90 it's good value for the price and I always have the latest version of everything,0
172,Miss the days you bought the office suite,0
173,Hate the annual renewal and the store on cloud instead on my laptop!,-1
174,The best deal I've found on a year of 365 BY FAR (it came to about $0,1
175,"05/day for a year of use across each license), and the number of licenses enabled me to set it up on my mom's laptop as well",0
176,I was even able to invite a friend to share a license,0
177,Re: Sharing licenses: You can ABSOLUTELY share licenses with other people without having to enable them to access or connect with your account in any way,0
178,"You'll be prompted to log into your Microsoft Account, where you'll be given the option to invite people via their email address to use a license",0
179,"Just ask them what email address they want to use for their Microsoft Account (if they don't already have one) and enter it in the field provided, then that's it",0
180,No further input is required from you,0
181,Very easy and totally private,1
182,"needed, got it below sales price, always good",1
183,Don't like that you have to buy this ever year,-1
184,What happened to buying it once and it's yours? I don't understand this at all,0
185,It's Microsoft Office,0
186,"So far, I've installed it on three computers (all of them Windows 10) without any problems",1
187,I'm not real fond of the latest version of Outlook but I've managed to get it to do what I want and get somewhat used to it,2
188,No real technical issues or other problems,0
189,Great price and fast shipping,1
190,I buy this every year from Amazon,1
191,Just before the year expiration comes due I get a message across the top of any MicroSoft Office programs that it is time to renew,0
192,"If I go that route the cost is a hundred dollars, if I get it from Amazon it is $75",0
193,And it is all the same there is nothing different that I can tell but the price,0
194,Great buy and product,1
195,"I returned this as I only needed one standalone app, EXCEL, for my purpose",-1
196,"Other than that, the whole software package really does the job",2
197,I would recommend it to any computer enthusiast,1
198,Used as renewal license,1
199,Works great,1
200,Rite price!,1
201,The price was right!,1
202,"Having paid $99 when I purchased MS Office 365 Home for a 1-year subscription, I was prepared to pay the same again to renew",0
203,"However, I was surprised to find I could, in fact, buy the renewal cheaper here on Amazon, instead of renewing through Microsoft",0
204,I was able to save about $20 renewing with Amazon vice Microsoft,0
205,"And, twenty bucks off the normal price for Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook, OneDrive, free online storage, access to Office Online, and a few more features",0
206,is a great bargain,1
207,"While many folks have migrated to free full office suites, or even use Microsoft Office Online or Google Docs, I prefer having MS Office 365 Home installed on my PC",0
208,Very little maintenance is required,1
209,"I manually check for updates every week, but I love not having to worry about keeping my Office products updated, because it's done automatically",0
210,"I have Office 365 Home installed on three PC's and have apps installed on my phone and tablet, ensuring I have access to all my Office products and personal documents any time I need it",0
211,"And, OneDrive makes sure I have all devices synced with up-to-date versions of my personal documents",0
212,Microsoft makes access to my Office documents easy and convenient,1
213,"And, Amazon has made renewing my yearly subscription more affordable and just as easy too",1
214,"I simply logged into my Microsoft account online, added my renewal product key, and checked the expiration date for renewal",0
215,The process was simple and took a few minutes to do,1
216,Works great,1
217,Perfect,1
218,I had purchased my initial subscription through Dell but I didn't want to renew with them,-1
219,"I was concerned by the mixed reviews of this product on Amazon, but they were misleading: renewal was super-easy",1
220,"And with Amazon Prime, I received the product the day I ordered it",0
221,"At first, I was a little concerned that I was sent a Product Key for a '1 year subscription for 1 household' 'Spanish and English' 'Office 365 Home Premium'",2
222,"Before opening the package, I called Microsoft",0
223,They confirmed that this was good for the US market and not some product licensed for a different geography,2
224,"To renew, I searched for 'Renew Office 365 for Home'",0
225,I selected 'Buy another year of Office from a Retail store',0
226,"I followed the instructions: I went to the link provided, entered the 25 character code I received",0
227,I pressed Next,0
228,Surprise! I was done,0
229,"(The instructions said that I would need to enter the Microsoft account associated with Office 365, but the registration page knew who I was because I was logged into my Microsoft Account on a different window",0
231,"Separately, I read that you can extend for up to five years, if you are so inclined",0
232,"I declined the option for auto-renewals, because I paln to follow this same procedure next year when I need to renew",0
233,It saved me 20 bucks,0
234,I followed the advice of previous reviewers and opted for the Microsoft key card over the download version,0
235,This is sound advice,1
236,There is no guarantee with the download version so if your download goes wrong you may well be out of luck,0
237,With the key card version you are able to call Microsoft for installation help,0
238,But the install instructions are clear enough so this options probably won't be necessary,1
239,Microsoft Office 360 has options I thought I would never use but I am already making more use of the product than I originally planned,1
240,I really think its a bunch of bull crap that we can't purchase out right and have this rental,-1
241,Not every one wants there stuff in a cloud,0
242,No dam privacy,0
243,What I expected!,0
244,"Great price, saved me 25% off",1
245,it works fine,1
246,I was afraid this would be online-only versions of office,0
247,It is an actual install locally with cloud integration,0
248,It is exactly what I was looking for,1
249,Although I only needed a 3 PC version,0
250,This is an updated version and well worth it,1
251,I have been using MS Office professional for decades,1
252,"This latest version simply provides the top version in the most convenient, automatically updated, and economical format",1
253,"The annual subscription renews the app on all 5 machines for a year, for under $100 ($20 per year per PC or device)",1
254,"I have had a number of scary moments with the Outlook component, but each was quickly fixed by the readily-available Microsoft telephone service for this product (I let them take over my machine and they quickly fix it in less than 10 minutes)",0
255,"Frankly, this telephone service deserves more than five stars--competing at a near-perfect level, despite competing support elsewhere in the software market being scandalously poor",-1
256,I didn't realize it was just a one-year subscription so that kind of sucks,-1
257,I wish it was a forever subscription,1
258,Great price and product,1
259,I put it on two PCs so far and it is okay,1
260,Typical long Office update learning curve as they feel the need to move all the familiar stuff for no apparent reason other than requiring the user to click more and spend time on the internet learning how to change settings,0
261,"One PC has the draw tab in all products, the other does not",0
262,Several searches has no provided a solution,0
263,One big complaint is the default for PowerPoint slides is a wide format that makes the page too big to print on 8,0
265,I need to set up my own default template,0
266,The best part of PowerPoint was always knowing it was standard page size and had a,0
267,5 hidden margin all the way around,0
268,I haven't put it on my main PC yet as I have to go through the long drawn out process of backing up files and making sure the old version is totally removed,0
269,"After that, I can play with 365 more",0
270,Just upgraded to Windows 10 so felt it necessary to upgrade my home software as well,1
271,I didn't have any issues converting my older documents to this new version and haven't had any issues using it although I haven't had enough time to really become familiar with the new Word and Excel,0
272,So I bought it quite quickly (straight from Microsoft Office Website) but I had to create a new Microsoft account to install it (which the customer service advised only after an hour of trying to figure out what was wrong) and the installation has been in progress for 15 minutes now :) I mean,0
273,first of all - WHAT? and second of all - if microsoft is trying to ramp up on the number of user IDs created to help their miserable demand - this is really not the smartest marketing move,0
274,I knew this was the way to go,1
275,It fits my lifestyle perfectly,1
276,I also have the previous version on my older computers,0
277,This is really a great buy,1
278,It breaks down to a full MS Office software suite for 5 computers plus 1TB of online storage,0
279,The storage alone is worth the price,1
280,"Well worth $100 per year, or less than $10 per month",1
281,"the main reason for my poor review is that every time you install Microsoft Office on a new computer, all the rules need to be re-created",-1
282,It works,1
283,What I received simply was not what was described,0
284,What I received was not for 5 PCs,0
285,Returned,-1
286,It was much easier when you just bought the software outright rather than this year to year,0
287,"I'm finding if you don't need bells and whistles, privacy issues aside Google could fit the bill",0
288,"Office 365 works well, and is a ""business"" standard",1
289,"I think the value of the Home package is clear; being able to install on 5 Macs or Windows machines is a savings for me, since I have an MacBook Pro (and VMware Fusion for Windows), as well as my Mac desktop with a similar VMware installation",0
290,"This allows me to install four instances, and still have a spare",1
291,"Only minor complaint, I started with the 30 trail",2
292,I installed three instances to give it a try on Mac and Windows,1
293,"Found it worked well, and bought the license key",1
294,"When my trial period was up, I entered my 1-year key",1
295,"It was accepted, but only a day or two later received an email that I had been charged $9",-1
296,99 for a one month subscription,0
297,"I had to call to get it sorted out, but the support rep was friendly and finally understood the situation",0
298,"Once he did, the charge was reversed and the account ""configured"" to coincide with my actual one year subscription",0
299,"The only other item, and this is the reason for removing one star:  the Mac and Windows versions are really different; more than expected",0
300,"The biggest and worst complaint, the Mac versions do not have the same features (for example the customizable ribbon) as the Windows counterparts",2
301,Microsoft really took a step backwards from Office 2011 (for Mac,-1
302,)  Hopefully they will get the Mac version into this decade,0
303,good,1
304,No problem loading the key and all is good for another 12 months!,1
305,Has to be setup by the person managing the Office 365,1
306,The first person to install Office 365 owns it,1
307,Great value,1
308,"I have office on all four of my computers, several tablets and a couple phones",1
309,Now the whole family can use office and the kids need it for school,1
310,I guess I spend about $25 a year per family member,0
311,Slow and glitchy,-1
312,"Takes forever to do simple Excel tasks like copy, paste, and print",1
313,Simple tasks make this thing gray out,0
314,"I'm running an Intel I7 processor, so I don't have a slow computer",1
315,It runs QuickBooks great and that's a lot more demanding than Office,1
316,This edition of Office sucks,-1
317,At work we use Office 2007,1
318,It works flawlessly,1
319,I'm going to download that and trash this,0
320,"I paid good money for this, but trash belongs in the garbage no matter how much you paid for it",0
321,"What a piece of s*** ""update""",-1
322,I use a PC at work and our IT department forced us to update to this piece Ospreys s*** update,-1
323,Typical Microsoft,0
324,"For every one thing that they improved, they screwed up 20-50 more",0
325,"Seriously, some very simple tasks as logging into email, saving files, and turning on an Out Of Office response are much more difficult to implement",-1
326,I wish I could revert back to the previous version,-1
327,"I would not have voluntarily installed this horrible update!

This is why I use a Mac at home!

You've totally botched it, yet again Microsoft!!!!
Wish I could give this update thing -1,000,000 stars!

Microsoft software is so bad, I really wonder if they themselves use this crap!!!",-1
328,"easy to install, works as normal office product",1
329,I cant install this office because is for Ireland and i buy in United States of America,2
330,Nice,1
331,I was led to believe I could use this product key to extend my current Office 365 subscription,-1
332,"But I after logging on to my Microsoft account and entering the key, I got this message;

""Did you originally buy Office from an app store? You need to wait for your current subscription to end before starting a new one",0
333,Just hang on to your product key until then,0
335,"I thought it was supposed to have full installed 2016 versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook,Publisher, Access, and Onenote",-1
336,Disappointed Access and Onenote did not install on Mac,-1
337,I was told those are only for Windows and not Mac,-1
338,Just what the family needs,1
339,"When sold by Hi-Tech Software, it's the wrong product",0
340,Activation key is only valid for the Middle East,0
341,Annoying to have to deal with a return,-1
342,Good program,1
343,"Seems to work fine, but I don't like being on the hook having to renew my subscription yearly",2
344,Great buy,1
345,would and will buy again,1
346,"Especially when paying less than the $99 annual subscription fee, I have been happy with having access to the full suite of MS products",1
347,"I don't know if it makes as much sense if you only use 1 license, but I'm always using 4 or 5 which justifies the cost a bit more",2
348,I've read some stuff about Microsoft customer service issues in the reviews,0
349,I have not had the need to contact them so I cannot speak to that,0
350,Microsoft office is fine,1
351,However I bought my parents a new computer and bought this for their computer,0
352,"Because I bought under my name, I couldn't transfer it to their computer",0
353,Ugg,-1
354,I long for the days of a CD disc,0
355,Wrong software,-1
356,It is only valid in China,-1
357,Had to return it and buy a download of the product,-1
358,Total BS!!!!! Was some foreign key code and nothing works,-1
359,"Won't return, because it is software! Region is not USA!",2
360,Great product - would buy again,1
361,As advertised,0
362,Works fine,1
363,Doesn't work when the internet is down,-1
364,I DONT LIKE THAT,-1
365,Bought this for the entire house,0
366,Very useful,1
367,"thanks, it was just what I had been trying to avoid but needed",1
368,Well worth the money,1
369,I'll do it again next year,1
370,There are two options available for purchase - a digital download sold by Amazon or a key card sold by 3rd party and fulfilled by Amazon,0
371,I went with the key card option because it was a little less money and figured I could wait 2 days for my prime delivery,2
372,"When I received the key card and entered it  on my Microsoft account, received error message that the product key wasn't meant for my region",-1
373,"When I read the label on back of key card package, it was for the middle eastern region",0
374,I returned the invalid key card to Amazon for refund,0
375,I then ordered the digital download version  from Amazon,0
376,"Immediately received product key and link to Microsoft for immediate activation, which worked perfectly",0
377,Simply the best deal for MS users,1
378,I was paying monthly for my account but this is less expensive option for 5 devices you can't beat this price,1
379,I wanted to make sure I did this right so I ordered the product key and install was a breeze,1
380,Easy to install,1
381,As promised,0
382,All is good,1
383,This was described as being able to use up ro three devices,0
384,Would only work on one,2
385,Disappointed,-1
386,I am happy with the product line but the account was difficult to setup and login was always a pain,2
387,I ended up not setting it up on all by devices just because it was to much work,-1
388,I really loved it when I could login and use it,1
389,I honestly think there are a lot of just as good alternatives these days,0
390,"I have been using Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides instead, so in my option save your money unless you really love the Office experience and can't live without it",2
391,I will say when I got my renew notice and I thought to myself,0
392,man I have paid for this for a whole year and still have not even figured out how to get into my account,-1
393,The tech guy walked me through it and I was able to login and use my account,0
394,I guess if you use Office at work it would be nice to have it at home too,1
395,But if you are like me and use it for home and not all that often,0
396,"Have kids that need it for school, well for that kind of stuff like I said earlier there are free alternatives now that work well",0
397,It works very well and exceeds my expectations,1
398,Sent me a product key for the middle east,0
399,I live in the U,0
400,Product Key will not work,-1
401,I've had some issues with the download of this product,-1
402,"I had to do it several times it recognized my product key, but the actual program would not save for ease of use to my desktop",0
403,"I haven't needed office in quite sometimes, and I am not one that will read through instructions, maybe the new way of office is web based?",0
404,very good software,1
405,"Beware of 24 7 Bargains, (Vendor)",0
406,Received this product and upon trying to activate got the message that this product was not designed for our location,-1
407,"In other words, this has a Geo Lockout according to Microsoft after spending 2 wasted hours on the phone with them",-1
408,"Bottom line, returned the merchandise",-1
409,"Vendor is listed out of California, I'm in Washington, product only works in some other part of the world, not USA or Canada",0
410,Needed this to put on personal computer to do grad work,0
411,Using Google was not good enough,-1
412,LOVE the APA formatted paper made this purchase worth every penny!,1
413,Just received this product key card from General - Liquidators and tried to use it,0
414,The product key was not accepted with an error that it was not meant for my region,0
415,I live in the US and General - Liquidators shipped this key card from KY,0
416,Contacted Microsoft support and they were not able to help me use this key,-1
417,I am returning this order,-1
418,UPDATE:  Painless return through Amazon and received another code that now works,-1
419,Changed rating according to product,0
420,I like Office 365,1
421,"Easy to use for multiple computers in our family, plus extra storage in OneDrive",1
422,This product does not work,-1
423,This product key isn't meant for your region,-1
424,"For help with this error, contact support",0
425,Still getting used to the differences from Office 2007,0
426,Takes time to adjust after years with another version,0
427,Have  not studied changes enough to determine if I like it better or not,0
428,I have converted all my computers to mac,0
429,"Having to purchase Office for ipads, Mac OS and Windows the cost is extraordinary",1
430,The 5 PC/Mac and tablets fits the bill,0
431,I am not a fan of renting the software but then again it's far cheaper with 365 than out right purchases,0
432,Just remember to pay the subscription fee and you'll be fine,0
433,Microsoft has come a long way with this package,1
434,The ipad apps are lacking in many aspects,-1
435,"However, I can transition from Mac to PC to ipad to iphone",0
436,This is especially helpful in word docs,1
437,A few of my friends have moved to google,0
438,Great program but even they admit there are some compatibility issues,2
439,Microsoft has me hooked but I find this product to be a very good value,2
440,Microsoft needs to work on making the process of registering multiple platforms easier,-1
441,The control panel stinks,-1
442,The one star does not reflect the product itself,1
443,"Rather, I purchased it here in the USA as a gift for my daughter in law who lives in Spain",0
444,It was very difficult to get the product usable in Spain; I'm not sure if it ever was made usable,-1
445,It's very disappointing to purchase a software produce here and then learn that it's not usable in another country,-1
446,excel does NOT have VBA,-1
447,"Great price, product exactly as described",1
448,Worked as advertised to extend my product subscription,1
449,Took a while for the key card to arrive in the mail,0
450,most likely delayed a couple of days due to Blizzard 2016 but I was getting nervous as my subscription was getting ready to expire,0
451,Make sure and order at least 2 weeks before your subscription expires,0
452,"Got too much advertisement with this, sent back",-1
453,This Office 365 key CANNOT be used in US (only in China),-1
454,Better price than buying from Microsoft,1
455,Just now loading software,0
456,Slow to load but seems to work as expected,2
457,Good price,1
458,After discovering how much MS wanted for a single slimy installation of Office 2016 (my preferred method of buying previously) I had already bought Office 365 and found this subscription,0
459,"If you want to save some money and can wait (or use the 30 day trial from MS), why not buy from Amazon here?",0
460,Worked fine,1
461,"However, the Microsoft installation was difficult and had to involve a chat with Indian staff and remote control of my computer to get it to download",2
462,Bait and Switch,-1
463,I called Microsoft ahead of time to talk to a representative about what support I would get with Office 365,0
464,I had Office 2013 installed so was already happy,1
465,"I was convinced I would get 24/7 support by either phone, chat, or email",-1
466,Lie,-1
467,"Yes, there there is a support line somewhere in the eastern hemisphere",1
468,The people on the other end of the line are trained in two things:  1,0
469,"Hanging up on you (it has happened to me three times, then MS sends me a survey asking about my support experience)  2",0
471,that type of support is outside our support boundary,0
472,new term for me: Support Boundary,0
473,The support you get is technical only,0
474,"That is, if you have a problem getting one of the programs to install",0
475,"If you want help using the program, you will get this response, ""Sir, go on the Web and find www",0
478,"There you will find some garbage that says ""We are creating more modules every day",0
479,"""  I would give it one star, but the saving grace is the included OneDrive TB of memory",2
480,"That's good, and, so far seems to work well",1
481,So what do I want out of this program?  Pretty easy,1
482,"I want MS Outlook to sync Contacts, Calendar, and Reminders between my phones and computers",0
483,It is impossible to figure out how to do this,-1
484,"You will find out that unless you have Office 365 for Business, Outlook does not reside in ""the cloud",2
485,"""  Maybe I can share a document with someone, but I defy you to figure out how to actually make that happen",0
486,Disappointed is an understatement,-1
487,It's microsoft,0
488,What else is there to say?,0
489,"I finally get it, if you need want to try online storage and have licenced office products this is a good choice for all you home PCs and Movil devices",0
490,Love it and easy to install and use,1
491,"Great price, very happy",1
492,"Never thought I would migrate to subscription software, but I am very pleased with it",1
493,I bought this as a renewal for the occasional use of Office in our family,0
494,My kids are both college students so sometimes they need to produce soft copies of papers in a MS file name,0
495,"When the key code arrived, I updated it to my account and then handed the card to my son, assuming that this worked like every other multi-computer key coded software on the planet",0
496,It doesn't,-1
497,My account changed to reflect that my subscription expired and my son's sign-up created a new account,0
498,I didn't know about this until MS contacted me to let me know that my service had expired,0
499,I followed their instructions and the date simply did not update - no explanation of why or what happened,-1
500,No error message,0
501,The process simply didn't result in an updated expiration date,-1
502,"So after sorting through MS web pages for 20 minutes to actually get service I could contact, I chatted with online help, who seemed confused themselves, didn't answer my questions and who ended the chat without helping 10 minutes later",0
503,"How do they expect a customer not to be frustrated by the time they even find access to online chat? Just because they don't know the answers themselves, they could check with someone else rather than ending the chat",-1
504,There are other similar office suites available that are both cheaper and similar in functionality,2
505,Some even allow files to be saved as MS file types,0
506,I bought this product because I'd used it professionally for years,0
507,I had no idea the product and especially service degraded to this level,-1
508,After this experience I don't think I'll ever buy Office again,-1
509,It's too bad Amazon won't allow this to be returned at this point,-1
510,So I now understand that you can only have one online account despite the up to 10 machines it promises to cover,0
511,Does that mean that only one person can use it and is expected to use it on 10 different computers and tablets? How does a second or third person access and use the software on another computer?,0
512,my  wife is happy,1
513,I bought a new Windows 10 computer which had Office365 pre-installed,0
514,"When I opened a Microsoft Office product on my computer, such as Word, it asked me for an activation key",0
515,So I put in this activation key and it activated the product fine,0
516,So no problems here in activating the product,1
517,I'll tell you what I don't like,0
518,It's the fact that that this is a subscription,0
519,To renew costs $99/year,0
520,Product description is very misleading,-1
521,"In the package material, for instance, we read that there are multiple languages available, a 1TB drive storage, etc",0
522,It's not until you get online and activate your product code and are asked for a payment to auto-renew in one year - that you realize something has gone terribly wrong here,0
523,I have bought several versions of Office over the years,0
524,I am willing to purchase it again,1
525,I am not willing to pay a pretty high (working class- educator income here) price to subscribe to this,0
526,Good way to get the yearly 365 home subscription,0
527,"I have a MacBook Pro, 2 iPads and 2 PCs all in use from the $80 a year",0
528,"I have gone through a few computers in the last few years, and having it as a subscription allows me to simply move the authorization to the next machine",0
529,If you keep a computer for a long time you might be better off just paying for the Office Student package for that one computer,0
530,Can't go wrong this office package,1
531,Long gone are the days that you can buy a copy of office and install it on all your friends computers,0
532,I upgraded to Windows 10 and decided to finally get rid of my old Office 2007 and figured I could use this bundle to install on all the kids machines,0
533,"You can activate the program on five different machines mac and PC, and you get expanded onedrive storage for all your documents",0
534,I activated the one year subscription on my Microsoft account and then invited the Husband and kids through the web interface,0
535,They all got access to the full suite of programs and also got the expanded storage,0
536,"The new version was easy to get used to, installed quickly and works flawlessly",1
537,Its time to upgrade that old version of office and the fact that you can install this one on five machines makes it a great value,1
538,"Its kind of hard to get excited about the new version of office, but hey it works just great, and I would recommend to others",1
539,I was disappointed when I saw the special coupon was attached after I ordered the laptop,-1
540,"I wish I would known, and I didn't buy this product at the purchase of the laptop",-1
541,Price fluctuations make this a product you buy when it's cheap,0
542,I waited two days and paid $20 more for it,0
543,4 stars for product itself,1
544,"If you use MS Office, you either like it or not",0
545,"It works for what I need, and at even the full list price, this is cheaper in my case than outright buying this",0
546,Plus I can share this with 5 other PC's,0
547,"This is my second year buying this and I have have had no issues with setting it up, sharing the software with my son (who is across the country from me), or any other operational issues using the product itself",0
548,"It's software, it works",1
549,The package arrived quickly and in new packaging,1
550,Office 365 is for work computer,0
551,"PRODUCT KEY IS NOT CURRENT, CANNOT BE UPLOADED, A $90",0
552,"00 RIP-OFF, ANOTHER DISHONEST SELLER HERE ON AMAZON",0
553,Good product,1
554,This was an incredible value for renewing my OFFICE 365 subscription,1
555,I am extremely happy,1
556,Works as advertised,1
557,Worked as described,1
558,The software is well known and excellent,1
559,It provides at least ten times the capabilities I need,1
560,The annual licenses are reasonable in cost since they amount to $20 per user,0
561,The licenses are easy to manage,1
562,I used this one-year package to extend an existing license,0
563,It took perhaps two minutes to access the website and enter the license key,1
564,I like that the added license extended the current license from the end of the previous license - no time is lost,0
565,"This is not true with Norton Security, for example",0
566,With Norton Security renewals are a timing hassle,0
567,always the latest updates sold me,-1
568,"If you have five computers, this is a great way to get office for them",1
569,This is my second year of usage and I'm glad I don't have to buy new software each time there is a new edition out,2
570,Dreadful,-1
571,"Had been using fine for a year and today got a ""Sorry, there was a problem while trying to connect to your account",-1
573,Called their support line 47 minutes in and passed from person to person while listening to highly distorted background music,-1
574,The 4th person I spoke to (who I had to describe the problem from scratch - MS support desk has no case notes??) diagnosed that the issue was that the 2011 version of office that was previously working was now no longer supported,0
575,1hr 34 minutes on the support line to get the problem resolved by installing MS 2016,0
576,Wow MS perhaps your cutting edge 'engineers' could have put that information on the error message instead,0
577,I think the monthly subscription is more hassle than its worth with all the tech and billing issues,0
578,"This is a word processor and slide presenter, not rocket science",0
579,Much simpler and cheaper to buy a standalone version and not have to deal with this waste of time,1
580,good product and any PC needs this,1
581,easy to install; shipped and arrived quickly,1
582,I love the product - it's easy to use,1
583,Microsoft support sucks,-1
584,could not install this thing and tried to call online Microsoft support,-1
585,"They do not speak English, and will not provide you with a solution to your simplest problem",-1
586,"As always is the case with Microsoft, Office for the MAC is deprecated or maybe just not ready for prime time",0
587,The Shortcut Menu bars can not be changed,0
588,Great job Microsoft,1
589,"Is anyone actually do a quality check on your products? As someone who work almost entirely with tables, the reduction in efficiency is unacceptable",0
590,"(can you imagine billing a client for the extra time is takes due to making a change to Office 2016?)
I have had to load win7 and Office 2010 in Fusion to complete my project",0
591,That's just wrong,-1
592,This is supposed to be the latest and greatest release of Office,0
593,Not So Much,0
594,Wonder how long before or if Office for the Mac will actually have the same features as the Windows version? Having said that some of the new features are very useful,0
595,It's like there is a piece of the product missing,0
596,"What is there is great, but it is far over shadowed by what is not there",0
597,It did not work someone had used it,-1
598,I did not return it,0
599,This is AWESOME,1
600,It updates regularly so that you always have the most current version of Microsoft Office,1
601,"Gone are the every-couple-of-years purchases of Microsoft 97, 2000, etc",0
602,I'm not even sure what we were up to anymore! All that is gone and washed away with a new yearly installment plan,0
603,It works really well,1
604,I appreciated that I could download it on to several different computers: both PCs and Macs,1
605,Loaded it and my internet wouldn't work,-1
606,Once I removed it the internet worked just fine,1
607,Good Value,1
608,Office365 is a no brainer,1
609,"For the price of cloud storage alone, I get Office on five computers and tablets and it is always current",0
610,If you originally purchased your Office 365 Home Subscription from Microsoft this will NOT work for renewal,0
611,I tried and kept getting errors and then called MS Support,-1
612,I was told that you had to use Auto Renew rather that use this package because to MS the product was different than the Office 365 Home Subscription they sell at the MS Store (They couldn't explain how),0
613,When I asked what I should do I was told to either start a second subscription under a different email address or wait for the original subscription to expire and start again,0
614,"Of course, letting the original subscription expire could also mean losing all of our data",0
615,This was confirmed by a supervisor in their support group,0
616,"So, the ""renewal"" on the Microsoft Office 365 Home Subscription box only renews a subscription that you purchased from a retail store (not the Microsoft Store)",0
617,"The product itself is the usual MS Office, not a lot has changed over the years",0
618,"A few tweaks, they still don't do collaborative editing very well unless you utilize their cloud versions which are far less feature-rich",0
619,"Overall, if the subscription works it's not a bad deal $20/year/user",0
620,"Also be warned, that if you put a credit card file on your account for Office 365 that credit card will also be accessible via any XBox device on your account (think children being enticed to buy games and add-ons)",0
621,Is what it says,0
622,"""iCloud for Windows currently supports Outlook 2007 through Outlook 2013",0
623,"If you use Outlook 2016, you can access iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendars on iCloud",0
625,"""  (This is from the Apple Support site as of Nov 11",0
626,")  On November 10, three different tech reps from Apple Support told me on the phone that iCloud for Windows does not support Outlook 2016 which is part of the Office 365 suite",0
627,That is why on install you go into a loop that keeps trying to repair iCloud for Windows,0
628,Irritating to now have to switch from Outlook to iCloud for Windows or iCloud,-1
629,"com to see my calendar, addresses and tasks",0
630,"UPDATE: On Dec 7th, Apple released an update to iCloud for Windows",0
631,The update now supports Outlook 2016,0
632,I purchased this from the Microsoft store because they assured me it was compatible with iCloud for Windows,0
633,It ran for a while but that was probably because I had remnants from Outlook 2011 still on my computers,0
634,Microsoft support said the issue was with Apple,0
635,Everything fine! No problems,1
636,Managed to upgrade my 30-day trial to a full year with the key card,0
637,"I'd prefer a non-subscription model for MS Office, but I guess everybody is going to a subscription model these days",0
638,"Update:
Been using it for about 6 months now, on multiple devices",0
639,"Skype calling, Office apps and OneDrive storage make this package deal one of the best deals around, at the price",1
640,"I even switched the iCloud storage on an iPad and iPhone my kid uses to start using OneDrive: the OneDrive interface is far superior, and reflects Microsoft's superiority in the arena",1
641,"Update2:
Purchased another from Amazon, and renewed my annual subscription very easily",0
642,The price of the key card is lower on Amazon than buying it from MS,0
643,They have added many more functions that are not necessary for the average user,0
644,"When I buy something that has the resources of Microsoft behind it, I expect solid performance which I didn't get",2
645,Perhaps Windows 10 is part of the problem but aren't they supposed to be compatible?  I use Excel and Outlook a lot and found numerous issues with Excel and some with Outlook,0
646,"On the positive side, Excel seems to be getting more stable and my old Outlook files were imported cleanly",0
647,Excellent product!!!  Getting better and better every time,1
648,A lot going on,0
649,Very different from old versions,0
650,I rarely use my laptop because it's difficult to navigate,0
651,I'll need to watch a tutorial to get more comfortable with the layout,0
652,A+++,1
653,#Office #Office2016 is a scam,-1
654,#Microsoft does not tell you Office 2016 is the first office suite that is incompatible to previous version of Office products such as #Project and #Visio,0
655,The solution you want to hear is on MS Website,0
658,"com/en-us/article/Special-offer-for-customers-with-Office-2016-and-Office-2013-standalone-applications-c32e3cad-e935-4163-a44f-50d896e10bbc

Here is the reality",0
659,I spent 80 min on the phone with Office tech support trying have Project and Vision working with Office 2016,0
660,"First, they had problem generating the key",0
661,Then transfer me to Sales agent who denied the existing of the free offer and hung up on me,0
662,"When I call back, I was transferred again and again between Office Tech support and Windows tech support in Philippine",0
663,They all told me that the only way I can use my Project and Visio again is to downgrade Office back to 2013,0
664,"Again, everyone denied the offer posted on MS website",0
665,I was hung up second time when I asked for manager,0
666,Please repost,0
667,"Maybe, if all of you repost it enough times, I may be able to get what MS promised on paper",0
668,"On the other hand, if you have Office 365 subscription and using Project or Visio, cancel the subscription",0
669,"The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options",0
671,"In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal",1
672,"So what exactly are you getting here?

This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps",0
673,"This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish",0
674,"It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part",1
675,"In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop",1
676,"Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use",1
677,I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works,1
678,"2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways",0
679,This package lets you use Office for a year,0
680,You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users),0
681,I added a year using this code,0
682,It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it,0
683,Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser,0
684,"The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same",0
685,"OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful",2
686,"The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a",0
687,", ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection",0
688,"OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc",0
689,I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people,0
690,"The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel",0
691,"My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC",0
692,"You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download",0
693,They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit,-1
694,"You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want",0
695,There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications,0
696,"The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines",0
697,"The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines",0
698,The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing,0
699,"Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space",0
700,"With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have",1
701,"The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work",1
702,And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier,0
703,I have this running on my Macbook Air and two HP laptops,0
704,Set up took less than 3 minutes,0
705,It is a one year subscription which is totally fine with me considering it averages out to $20 per year,0
706,Worth the money,1
707,"It is not hard at all to put it in the computer, it's easier than the CDs and you can share it with several computers",0
708,It's office 365,0
709,Comes with like 10 TB of cloud storage,0
710,I thought I was getting a bargain when I bought this item,0
711,When the time came to load it in my computer 2 numbers were illegible on the code card,-1
712,Because of this I could not load it,0
713,"I called Microsoft for help and their solution was to buy a ""genuine"" product for $ 99",0
714,I returned it and wanted to get a replacement and of course now I can't get it at the original price and have to pay the full price,-1
715,"This is a ripoff, I think I should have been able to get a replacement for the same price since it was a typo error but no one was willing to help me with the issue",-1
716,"Thank You Amazon, thank you Microsoft for being so helpful!!!",1
717,it is Office,0
718,Added another year to my subscription,0
719,good,1
720,It keeps crashing on my MAC,-1
721,As advertized,0
722,Recommended,1
723,Wow Microsoft has really upped there game with Office 2016,1
724,I find that its worth it for the year for for the 1TB of OneDrive alone,1
725,I was never a fan of Microsoft but they seem to be really making great software and services these days,1
726,Nothing but glitches,-1
727,I have to close out every ten minutes or so because randomly I will have charts or images that are within word documents disappear,0
728,Freezes like you would not believe and they now charge you per year?! Screw Microsoft!,0
729,"Arrived as expected, installation was simple and easy",1
730,"What's not to like?  You get the latest software from Microsoft at a discounted rate, it updates quietly in the background, and all the spiffy toys are included",0
731,"I was going to buy it anyway, then discovered that Amazon offers a significantly better price",1
732,Just received the new versions for 2016,0
733,I plan to look for this deal again next May,0
734,I own this,1
735,It works great on the first computer I installed it on,1
736,Once deciding I wanted to use it on some of the other 4 devices (several months later),0
737,"I found that getting into my account, sharing the service, and installing it on another device was a total nightmare that has consumed the majority of the last 24 hours of my life",0
738,"Come on, Microsoft",0
739,"You are supposed to make me more productive and efficient, not have me guessing where to go, changing my passwords, installing, freezing, uninstalling, and re-installing stuff for hours!

Also, what's with asking my for a password regarding the online storage?  I don't even use it so why prompt me for a password?
Leave me alone and let me work!!!!!!!

UPDATE:  I was irritated when I wrote that",0
740,"It's very convenient once you get all devices going,  It's affordable,  The tech support is unparalleled",1
741,Still don't like the password prompts!,-1
742,Integrated perfectly with the account I already had so I was able to renew at a discount,0
743,I just added the code to my MS account and it works like a gift card,1
744,No problems,1
745,"I'll be doing this every time, if I can",0
746,"I hated to lose my Office 2003 (yes, that's how old it was) but I really do like Office 365",2
747,"Install was a little confusing because it didn't automatically make icons for me, but I figured it out",2
748,Really do like how Outlook works,1
749,That setup was VERY easy,1
750,This was such a rip off on Microsoft's part,-1
751,They basically make you pay them $99 for life or you lose access to all your work basicly,0
752,This has made us switch to Apple and Google,0
753,"Bought this for the cloud storage primarily, the software is just a bonus in my opinion",0
754,"What's there to say about Office?  Everyone uses it, you can't get away from it, so why not subscribe to this and get the latest version as it becomes available as well as 1TB of cloud storage for up to 5 computers?  Done",0
755,Easy to use,1
756,As expected,0
757,good price for this s/w,1
758,I needed a replacement for the 2013 Microsoft Office; works great with my Window 8,0
759,This has been super so far,1
760,Used all five of the downloads and have enjoyed using all of the Office Products,1
761,A very good deal!,1
762,Easy to use system - at $100 for a year it's not terrible,2
763,The UI of the modern offices are better than the ones I've been used to (e,0
764,"2007) and work about the same, no learning curve",0
765,I really only ever use word and excel,0
766,Did not meet expectations,-1
767,Software did not download properly on my iMac and  Microsoft support was lackluster at best,2
768,I returned product for a full refund,-1
769,"As always, Microsoft struggles with making instructions easy to understand",-1
770,Happy with the price and the fast shipping,1
771,Received it when they said it would be here,0
772,Great price also,1
773,As described,0
774,Down loaded and started using,0
775,"Simple, easy up and running",1
776,Outlook does not work with our firm's server,-1
777,"Excel and Word work fine - but I see no improvement over Office Mac 2011, which I should have stuck with",2
778,"I don't use PowerPoint, so that is not a consideration for me",0
779,We like it,1
780,Great software and price,1
781,Great price on pricey software,1
782,Product is a mixed bag,2
783,I'm a huge fan of the 5 user concept in which you can share this between 5 total users in your household with each person getting their own 1TB OneDrive account and access to Office 365 on multiple devices,0
784,My issue with Office 365 is that the office suite portion is buggy as all hell,-1
785,"After installing on 2 desktops and 3 different laptops Word, Excel, and PowerPoint would all stop responding for no apparent reason on a very regular basis",-1
786,So regular that doing any work within Office was impossible,-1
787,These issues could not be satisfactorily resolved through patching/updates or reinstallation of the Office suite or even starting from a clean install of Windows,-1
788,"Thankfully, I still had office to my Office 2010 media and after completely removing Office 365 I was able to get each computer back to a stable Office platform",0
789,"Hopefully this issue, whatever it is, will be addressed in the upcoming update to 365",0
790,I will say that Office 365 works great on my Macbook Pro and on iOS devices,0
791,Can you feel the irony?,0
792,I have a subscription and in my account it shows PC/Mac install used is 0,0
793,"However, when I'm trying to activate my Office installed on Windows, it says I've already reached install limit",0
794,"It asks me to go to my account to deactivate an install, but the webpage doesn't list any install so there's nothing to deactivate",0
795,Now I have 7 months subscription left but unable to use the software,0
796,Microsoft promotes people asking community,0
797,I did and not unexpectedly it helped nothing,2
798,Then I finally figured out a way to chat with a support guy,0
799,He collected whole bunch of my information and told me there's an outage at Microsoft server and asked me to wait 24 hours,0
800,Now 2 days have passed and issue still not resolved,0
801,"Today I reached the chat support again, and Francis Philip (display name Francis M) asked me to wait 24-48 hours again",-1
802,No apologize and no compensation,-1
803,I told him I'd already asked to wait,-1
804,"He then said, I could contact someone else in India if I wish, because that's Office 365 guy",0
805,I thought I already selected the Office 365 category and now I was asked to dial an India number for solving my issue that caused by Microsoft,0
806,I told him I'm on a paid time subscription and now unable to use the software I've paid for for several days,0
807,He then said I could cancel my subscription and create a new one if I wish,0
808,I told him I'm going to cancel but never renew again,-1
809,"He then sent me a number for billing straightly, with no more explanation",0
810,So basically he was not willing to help me anything and kept giving me numbers to dial,-1
811,"So basically Microsoft is switching to a business model that keeps charging users monthly but not a one-time cost, then when there's an issue at their side preventing user activating, they'll just keep user waiting, neither providing a workaround to at least allow user use the software for now, nor trying to solve the issue right now, not to mention compensation",0
812,I will never ever spend a penny at Microsoft,-1
813,"There wasn't a readily available place to submit feedback (Help > Leave Excel Feedback is no longer available, as with so many options), so I'm doing it here in hopes it reaches Microsoft",-1
814,"(1) There is no longer the option to create custom shortcuts via Tools > Customize Keyboard, which I find are essential for automating Paste Values",0
815,(2) Scrolling right by holding shift and scrolling down is no longer smooth,0
816,"(3) When producing a Stacked Column chart with no gaps between the bars, and tick marks falling within the center of the bars, the bars on the far left and right are cut off, and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix this",0
818,"It's frustrating that this was released for Mac before it was actually ready, even with regard to some of the most basic functionalities",-1
819,I have returned to using my previous version for some time,-1
820,This is a good deal and it's easy to install,1
821,Love this,1
822,just wish you could buy it once and be done for the lifetime of your computer!!  Good business for them bad for us!!  But what is knew right!!??,0
823,Word changed everything on my computer! Everything looks and acts different and I'm not happy about it,-1
824,Love this software,1
825,Great so far,1
826,Easy download no problems with start up,1
827,Exactly what I ordered and had no problems at all activating it,1
828,Don't like it being online and not private like original,-1
829,"Attempting to use this product has been a truly horrible, maddening experience, wasting countless hours of my time, from the installation, which wouldn't work at all as they instructed--and I had to call a tech person (in India, clearly) and spend one to two hours on the phone per computer to get Office working, with the tech having to take over my computers to do it",0
830,"Then also for some reason, when I open Word on my Mac computer now, half the time it requires me to sign in with my user name and password to get into my own Word program! And if you're not online, then you're out of luck! It's infuriating",0
831,Very buggy program and makes me feel like Microsoft is now in control when I can and can't use my software that I paid for,-1
832,I have to waste my time looking up my password at least twice a week to open my docs in word,-1
833,"And today, I put in my user name and password on two computers and it's STILL not opening up my program",-1
834,So now I have to call India again and probably spend another couple hours getting Microsofts bugs resolved,0
835,Just a disaster of a product,-1
836,"Needless to say, I will not be renewing this subscription",-1
837,Having access to all updates and support is valuable!,1
838,Good,1
839,Key is easy to use for new Office 365 installs or renewals,1
840,Just need an internet connection,0
841,Much better than paying full price direct to msft,0
842,I usually check Amazon first before doing direct software downloads for things like tax software,0
843,You can usually get a better price than direct from the manufacturer,0
844,"Better than buying MS Office licensees for more than two PCs, even if you have to renew it annually",0
845,"Have it on 3 laptops, an android tablet and a data phone",0
846,"The instructions on the key card were written in Spanish, which had me a little concerned, but the key worked just fine",0
847,What else can I say?,0
848,"not that easy to understand or install, documentation should be better",-1
849,"There really is nothing better than Office - sure there is OpenOffice - and some others like Hancom Office, but when it comes to a complete package, the industry standard Microsoft Office 2013 (365) is the best",0
850,"I knocked off a star because of the stupid installation I had to go through:

Enough on that - here is where you will have problems installing this product:
If you were a student at a University/College that gave you a free copy of Office 365 (or Office 2013) Pro edition:
The Pro Edition is a limited use product",-1
851,It is tied to your student email account - or in my case it was tied to my personal account and school account (double badness for me),-1
852,"When you graduate, finish, take a break, etc - your school IT department will cut you off from the use of Office Pro",0
853,You must use either the new web browser with Windows 10 (Edge) or Internet Explorer when you are logging into your Microsoft account and then attempting to establish a new or revised account when replacing your old school authored version of Office 365,0
854,Tor Browser and Firefox will not work correctly,-1
855,"Tried to establish a new account with the new key - did not work
Tried to remove the school version of Office - did not work
Tried to re-associate my email with a new Office account - did not work

You cannot just change the email associated with your former school account and the Home version",-1
856,In my case I had to call up Office,0
857,"com support and have them remove my personal email account from its association with Office Pro (school account) and then enter my new product key, associate my personal email account with the product key, then force the install of Office 365 Home",0
858,"After the install, Office 365 (2013)  Pro (school account software) was removed and a Microsoft tool called 'Fix It Solutions' - which essentially removed all the registry entries and hidden files related to the school account",-1
859,If you look under your File + Office Account then your User Account - then Manage Account - you will be taken to a page where you will either login to a Microsoft account or you will be forced to login with your student ID/student email account,0
860,Even with a new product key - and the intention of creating a new account - the Pro (school) software prevented me from downloading and installing a new copy of Office Home - due to registry restrictions and a pushed download associated with the Pro (school) version,0
861,Not sure why my school did this - or if it was unintended or just a stupid IT department requirement,0
863,com tech support was able to resolve the conflict with no issues - and I was very happy with the prompt attention Microsoft gave,1
864,I love the software as a subscription model; I don't need to worry about having to purchase new versions to get new features or bug fixes,1
865,"Great price, but delivery a little slow for some thing that ships in an envelope",1
866,"Good transaction, no Problems!",1
867,Excellent,1
868,Great Price by the seller,1
869,I am currently overseas and it does not work,-1
870,"It recognizes my overseas IP address and it states ""this produce is not intended for your identified region""",0
871,"I do not return to the US until later this year, so what do I do?",0
872,Office 365 home is a fantastic service for my family of 5,1
873,"Each of us gets our own suite of Office apps, OneDrive storage (1TB each) and 60 minutes of Skype Minutes",0
874,Its a good deal even at the rate of $99 that Microsoft sells it for,0
875,"But this deal is even better when you buy the card on Amazon!  You can save around $25 for the yearly service this way, and get the exact same service!  Yes this card/key can renew an existing subscription",0
876,"When you renew your account with the product key on this card, it will cancel the automatic renewal if you were using that directly with Microsoft",0
877,"Next time you get close to renewal, just buy another card and renew again with a product key",0
878,I couldn't be happier,1
879,What a deal!!  I was able to get Office 365 for less than on the Microsoft site!,1
880,Worked great,1
881,Loaded them up on my computers with no issues,1
882,Office 365 Home for 5 PCs or Macs offers exceptional value for the money,1
883,"In addition to installation on up to 5 PCs or Macs you also get 1TB of Onedrive space for each user, 60 minutes of Skype per month and you can load the mobile applications on up to 10 devices",0
884,With the subscription you always get the latest updates of the software,0
885,For the Mac we were recently upgraded from the 2011 to 2016 version at no additional cost,0
886,Mac 2016 now brings the Mac version very much in line with the PC versions,0
887,The subscription also makes it very easy to move your subscription from an old computer to a new computer,1
888,Just deactivate the old computer and then activate the new computer,0
889,You don't necessarily need to us all the subscriptions yourself as you can allow other family members to use these licenses,0
890,AWESOME!!! No troubles installing,1
891,Have installed on 3/5 systems,0
892,Do not buy! Does not work and customer service is not Microsoft,-1
893,Had lots of problems with this company,-1
894,Had to pay to have computer wiped clean to get it off! This is been a huge mess!,-1
895,What i needed,0
896,"In relation to costs and the amount of revenues they earn, MSFT continues to be the worst software provider",-1
897,"Each update rearranges or changes the look of the program for additional cost WITHOUT fixing any existing bugs that constantly cause the program to crash; instead, these new versions add more bugs to the existing ones causing more crashes (and lost work)",0
898,I do not understand why a competitor cannot make a decent office suite,-1
899,Nor do I understand why the corporate world continues to use this sh*t program other than most people in non-tech industries are tech retards and too lazy to learn a new program,-1
900,"ordered, delivered, entered the key on the link printed on the back of the card, got 1 year of office365 cheaper than anywhere else",0
901,what more can you ask for,1
902,"If you don't mind waiting a few days for the postcard to arrive, this is perfect",1
903,No fuss way to get 5PC's outfitted with office,0
904,Who wouldn't do this??,0
905,"Like it, worth all the money",1
906,"I wasn't happy that they did away with the version with the disc, but downloading it did not take long",-1
907,"Plus, it can be installed on up to 5 devices",1
908,"Extended my subscription by 365 days, and for far less than the yearly amount!",0
909,I bought this as an upgrade to my Office 2011 for Mac,0
910,Office 2016 is miles and miles ahead of 2011!  The Office functionality is exactly as expected,1
912,"The statement that you can ""install on 5 PC/MACs"", is somewhat misleading",0
913,"Here's what I have experienced:
I have 2 Macs (a MacPro and a Macbook) which I share with my wife; we both have our individual logins on both of these machines",0
914,"I did a single install on each of them, and then each of us logged into the Office apps to activate them",0
915,"When I go to the account page, it shows me that 4 installs have been used, not 2 as I would have expected from the licensing description",0
916,"So even though I have 2 installs, on 2 machines, used by the same 2 users, I have used 4 installs, instead of the expected 2",0
917,"I contacted support via the My Account page, and they've told me that's the way this is supposed to work",0
918,"Although somewhat disappointed, I am happy because it does what I need it to do",2
919,"Kind of wish the literature would have done a better job at explaining that it's 5 ""logins"", rather than installs",0
920,Great deal on this year long subscription!,1
921,Appreciated the discount price vs MS store,1
922,Same as last year - no problems with updates,1
923,"As a Mac user, I've been sitting on the sideline regarding Office365 until they released the new Office for Mac (Office 2016)",0
924,After using the Office 2016 beta for months (without any licensing errors,0
925,"I wonder how long I could have kept using it), I'm noticing a number of improvements that come along with the Office 365 subscription",0
926,"Hassle-free, full-featured installs on a to of devices? Check",1
927,Seamless dropbox integration across all devices? Check,0
928,I've got zero buyer's remorse over 30 days in,0
929,"Everyone will decide for themselves if they want to make the leap to Office 365, but if you are",0
930,why wouldn't you take the 20-30% discount by ordering the subscription this way?,0
931,great for new students to have and can be on multiple devices,1
932,Thats great :),1
933,"Hard to beat this price (it was about 25% off retail when I purchased, but consistently undercuts MSRP)",1
934,Second time I've used one of the year sub cards for Office 365 that I purchased off of Amazon,0
935,No problems at all,1
936,The Office 365 Home with Key card worked fine on my two Windows desktops,1
937,"However, Microsoft stated that I would get 1TB of additional cloud storage with the subscription Key card",0
938,This did not happen,-1
939,After calling Microsoft they stated that it was probably because I did not get it from the MS store,0
940,After a lot of annoying back and forth they updated my cloud storage,2
941,Up and running again in a few minutes,1
942,My subscription was expiring,0
943,Just logged in and entered the new key,0
944,It was that easy,1
945,Excellent Product!!!,1
946,It installed flawlessly over my existing copy of office 2007 - even keeping all of my contacts and Excel/Word recent documents,1
947,I was only able to load on 2 computers and not 5,0
948,"For some reason, Microsoft doesn't recognize the key",-1
949,I'm disappointed because my old PC died and I can't load this onto my new PC,-1
950,Not cool!,-1
951,Very easy to set up all 5 pc's,1
952,Much more user friendly than version I got last year,1
953,"I'm sure it is worth the fee, but not what one thinks he/she is buying",2
954,"They would have you believe you will get the offline Office products for each device/computer, but you only get it for one",0
955,"When you try to edit MS documents in-line (on all  but one device), you can't do much and get stamp-sized documents to deal with",0
956,Brian Hoang is excellent to work with!,1
957,It works,1
958,I own MS office 10 but recently fixed up a laptop and purchased a Dell Venue tablet,0
959,I appreciate Microsoft's approach to allowing a user to install the latest version of office on all of their devices,1
960,"Nice Price for the 5 pc user, worth the price and easy download",1
961,"Just too easy, I got the key card sent to me",1
962,About to renew with the same seller,0
963,Not as user friendly as it could be,-1
964,It can be confusing enough that sometimes you need the tutorial just to move around,0
965,installation was difficult; needed online chat help and 1 hour of them in control of my computer to make right,2
966,"near as I could tell, no fault of mine",0
967,should not have required so much intervention but I'm glad they had it available to me,0
968,Did not need or install the product,0
969,"Came as described, quickly and I was super easy to install",0
970,Wonderful price and it comes with One Drive for all your cloud storage needs,1
971,You get software and cloud storage for less than what google drive and drop box are charging for just cloud storage,0
972,"Great Deal!  UPDATED: I have purchased this same product for two years now, very happy each time!",1
973,I am totally disappointed when dealing with microsoft product that involves having an account with them,-1
974,Reactivating Office 365 subscription with them is a nightmare,-1
975,The sooner one can sever their relationship with microsoft the better,0
976,Skype account is a big joke too,-1
977,It's just so difficult to figure out what you are doing wrong in the set up when they keep on looping you back to the same process without indication on what you should do different,0
978,Having your PC administer by them through account sign in is ceding total control of your own PC with them,0
979,This has to stop,-1
980,Another rip off from Microsoft,-1
981,Having to pay an annual fee,0
982,What happened to the days when it was preloaded on your computer when you bought it,0
983,Then it went to having to buy the program and now they want an annual fee,0
984,Isn't it bad enough that you have to buy a new computer every 3-5 years these days? My first computer lasted 10 years,0
985,"I've always avoided Office on my home PCs due to cost, but now that Microsoft includes unlimited OneDrive space with this annual office subscription, it's hard to pass this up",-1
986,"One thing to note, when you first log in, OneDrive is going to tell you that you have a 1TB limit (which is still a decent amount of space)",0
987,"I contacted MS support, and they indicated it is indeed unlimited space, and that whenever you hit the limit that's shown you'll be bumped up to the next tier automatically (so when I hit 1TB, I will be bumped to 10TB at no additional cost)",0
988,"We had tried all the various versions of the free office suites, but they were all missing something we needed, such as the ability to quickly and easily do labels/envelopes, or the ability to import really huge text files into the database program",0
989,"Additionally, we have three kids and four PCs, and the schools very heavily use Office",0
990,Having the same program at home and school is a huge plus,0
991,"Adding the unlimited online storeage, and this is a great deal",1
992,The one drive isn't working as described,-1
993,Very unhappy,-1
994,Good,1
995,I thought I bought it outright but it's only good for 365 (days) I feel like an idiot for buying it,0
996,Someday Microsoft will learn that selling half-functional junk will hurt them,-1
997,Worst piece of software I've ever used,-1
998,"Constantly needs to be reloaded because somehow Outlook tells me it's up to date, when it's not",-1
999,Of Course You Know It's A Great Product,1
1000,Easy To Install,1
1001,Easy To Follow Instructions And Directions Online As To Add Another User On The Account,1
1002,So Many Templates To Use For Everyday Needs,0
1003,"As Long As You Have The Subscription which Lasts A Year, You Will Get the Latest Office Software And Updates",0
1004,I Will Recommend You Get Office 365,1
1005,As much as I hate to do it (it's Microsoft) this works exactly as advertised,-1
1006,I'm not a big proponent of cloud-based software,-1
1007,"For the price on this tho, it works",1
1008,Just as expected,1
1009,Fast service,1
1010,really enjoy this upgrade,1
1011,It is so nice to keep files on the MS cloud,1
1012,"When I open any of 5 devices, the files are right there - the same on all computers",0
1013,Best price in town on Amazon - as expected,1
1014,It's all very Microsoft-y,1
1015,"Why is it cheaper to buy and ship a physical card for a virtual service than it is to simply buy it online? But ok, it is",0
1016,After upgrading Word with the product key it then deleted all my cloud based documents in my existing account,0
1017,Welcome to Microsoft's cloud service,0
1018,They will figure it out eventually but they haven't yet,0
1019,Installing on a 2015 MacBook was also problematic requiring a force quit of the installer after an error was encountered registering with an existing account,0
1020,Not for novices,0
1021,"Works well! Use for Outlook and Word, Excel!",1
1022,I have spent 2,0
1023,75 hours on my new computer trying to install this crap and I wish I would have invested $400 to buy the permanent version,0
1024,Program Ok but would like it better if I Only paid for what I use,2
1025,Went to redeem key and product had already been redeemed in Nov 2014 by someone else,0
1026,"Good deal, but shipping was slow",2
1027,Perfect!!!,1
1028,Good price for this,1
1029,office 365 is better than the trial everything works the way it is supposed to,1
1030,"Haven't had time to use much, but pleasant to use so far",1
1031,More later perhaps,0
1032,I bought this to continue my Office 365 subscription for another year,0
1033,"I was afraid that I might hit a snag, since this item is not advertised as a possible continuation of an existing subscription, but it worked just fine",2
1034,This certainly is significantly cheaper (though more time consuming) than updating directly from Microsoft,1
1035,"The purchase part of the process was easy, economical, and fast",1
1036,So I would rate Amazon a five,1
1037,"But, the MS Office support was painful, slow, and only took four different representative an hour before they got my Office 365 Home to install",-1
1038,I am an Apple user who is used to hardware and software that just works without having to call a bunch of foreigners,0
1039,So I would rate MS Office support a one at best,1
1040,Sure hope MS comes out with a Mac Office upgrade before this one-year license expires or it is bye bye MS!,0
1041,"It was fine, so far as the purchase, it was the download of Office 365 where the difficulty began",2
1042,Once I installed Office it would open a document and it would not stay open,0
1043,I tried a number of times and it did the same thing,0
1044,I uninstalled and reinstalled several times and then gave up and just reinstalled my Office 2010,-1
1045,Then I contacted Microsoft by email requesting assistance,0
1046,The women who called me and introduced herself as a Microsoft Tech listened to my problem and took me through step by step and after it was completed - the new Office 365 worked great,0
1047,She had me remove some of the software that was interfering with installation,0
1048,Very helpful,1
1049,Very satisfied with the upgrade,1
1050,"Says it includes Access, but does not",2
1051,gotta have it if I want to use my fav apps,0
1052,"Works as described, added one year to my subscription",0
1053,Office 365 really is more then just office,1
1054,It is the coming together of Windows 8,0
1055,OneDrive and Office to really start offering a modern competitive computing service,0
1056,"At less then $100 for a year subscription, its cheaper then office used to be if you kept up with the new releases",0
1057,"That it includes 1TB of OneDrive really completes the picture for a unified follow-you-anywhere productivity suite,

In general the 2013 versions of the Micrsoft office products are excellent",0
1058,Particularly of note is Word 2013 which *finally* does a *good* job of importing PDFs and handling more sophisticated document layout,0
1059,My only complaint is really a OneDrive complaint,2
1060,"Like al lthe other current cloud services,  OneDrive by default syncs all its files locally",0
1061,This can make a problem when you work on both big storage desktops and small storage mobile devices like a Surface,0
1062,"When Microsoft adds LRU caching with opt-in per-file ""stickiness"", they will have a perfect system",0
1063,My son needed to do a pwer point project for school,0
1064,Had no current Office product on our computer,0
1065,This worked great for him,1
1066,What a deal!  License Office 365 on up to five Apple and Windows machines for less than $100 per year,0
1067,"Yes, that is less than $20 per year per machine or 40 cents per week per machine",0
1068,That truly is a bargain for use of the latest Office software,0
1069,I'm so glad I finally upgraded from Office 2007 and 2010 to Office 365,1
1070,It's truly a significant advancement over the older versions,0
1071,"My wife and I use it in 1 desktop, 2 laptops, 3 iPads, and 2 iPhones, and the convenience is fantastic",1
1072,Being able to change and update files on even my iPhone and have them work perfectly when we get back to one of my computers has allowed us to quit lugging around our laptops,0
1073,"When we would use some of the Apple applications such as Keynote and Pages, we could not depend on the changes in the final files and always had to re-edit them",0
1074,"No more thankfully! Also, once you get used to the new interface it is great",1
1075,I find many things easier to do and manage in each program,1
1076,I highly recommend anyone using the older versions of office to upgrade,1
1077,"While no software is ever perfect, this comes very close to perfect for my needs",1
1078,One last thing - I've had issues using Outlook for years but no longer,0
1079,"Whatever they've done to the program, it now works great, not only on my desktop and laptop, but even on my iPad and iPhone",1
1080,Great for splitting among family,1
1081,MS Office isn't cheap,0
1082,"Watch this item, the price varies quite a bit",0
1083,You can often find it for about $70,0
1084,"Office 365 subscription with five licenses for the price of one? Yes, please!",0
1085,"If you use 5 PCs this is a great deal - always current software, simple, easy and the full Office software",0
1086,Access from anywhere,1
1087,"Great for home, students and business",1
1088,Price was good & delivery on time,1
1089,Item is as described,0
1090,No problems,0
1091,Remember this is RENTAL software,0
1092,By far the most cost effective way to purchase Office 365,0
1093,GOOD PRODUCT,1
1094,"It's useful, but the other reviews are worrying me a lot",2
1095,Got just what I expected quickly,1
1096,Installation was quick and easy,1
1097,I recommend this selection to anyone who want affordable use for these programs,1
1098,Not very impressed!  I have used outlook for years with the latest being Office 2013,-1
1099,"No matter what I do outlook online will only pull up with the ""hotmail"" format",0
1100,No ribbon on the top to do the functions I use,0
1101,"Oh, and talk about ads on the side?????",0
1102,Arrived on time,1
1103,No problems installing and activating Office 365,1
1104,great price,1
1105,"I didn't know if I would like having online office, but it has grown on me",1
1106,"I now enjoy having office on every PC I use, plus all the extra storage with OneDrive",1
1107,Great bargain,1
1108,How absurd -- software you have to pay for annually,-1
1109,A very bad idea that will send a lot of people to Open Source,-1
1110,It is good,1
1111,Funky and unpredictable; this is a buggy product,-1
1112,After 10 months MS-Project stopped functioning and asks for product activation each time it is turned on,-1
1113,"Crazy huh?  Unfortunately, product activation does NOT work and I need MS-Project for my consulting work",-1
1114,I am working overseas so have little recourse,0
1115,"Microsoft does not produce a quality well integrated office suite, though it is the one I and everyone else uses",-1
1116,"Each year the interface appears to be more awkward, the programming becomes more cumbersome, and more bugs are added, resulting in continuing diminished stability and funtionality with each new release",0
1117,Office 365 Home is one of the best deals you can get,1
1118,5 Machines and you can share the account with 5 people,1
1119,Unlimited One Drive storage,0
1120,This purchase was for renewal of our original Office 365 installation,0
1121,"While I normally do NOT like subscription software, Office 365 offers very good value, even considering the nominal annual renewal fee",0
1122,"Before Office 365, the cost of buying and upgrading the various components might well have cost several times the Office 365 renewal fee, especially when Amazon and others offer the product at a lower price than Microsoft direct",0
1123,We got this for 2 Macs and 2 Windows machines,0
1124,It works OK on both platforms,1
1125,"I use it mostly on a Mac, now",0
1126,"I don't like that almost every time I go to use it, there's yet another update to go through",-1
1127,It's really annoying,-1
1128,We've since gone with the monthly online version,0
1129,very good,1
1130,"Prompt delivery and no problem, saved money against what Microsoft charges!",0
1131,Great Price,1
1132,and it Worked,1
1133,Could not install on 2nd computer,-1
1134,Excellent product,1
1135,What can you say great product,1
1136,"$74 for 5 Computers, 5 Tabets, and 5 Phones, Plus 60 mins for Skype AND 1 TB of OneDrive each is a total deal! I'm not sure what the problem is with other people, but I can tell you that this is an amazing deal! Sure, who really wants to pay X amount of dollars every year for Office, but when you add up all the other bonuses it really becomes pretty obvious that this is a bargain",0
1137,"I know, I don't *OWN* the software anymore but I'm paying $15 per user a year for the software AND the extras so why not?  The 1 TB of OneDrive storage itself is worth it, plus the bonus of always being on the latest version of software so to me it's a no brainer",0
1138,Your family will love you for it,1
1139,"Do it!

Also, as far as Macs are concerned the latest version available is Office 2011 so although you'll get the Office 365 Licensing model you won't get the actual latest and greatest version of the software",1
1140,You can however download the latest Preview (2016) and use that and when that becomes release you'll be upgraded as part of your subscription,0
1141,"Actually there is no reason not to do that since you can install and run both concurrently, so why not?",0
1142,Buyer beware,-1
1143,I purchased a physical box with a key because it was cheaper,1
1144,But the seller sent me a key for the Middle East region and it does not work for US customers,-1
1145,Hoping it's not too late to return it,-1
1146,"Typical Microsoft, It took hours to install this stupid software",-1
1147,Then its only good for a year,0
1148,This company is floundering in it's own greed,-1
1149,Pros:  The code worked fine,1
1150,Was easy to use the Microsoft site to register it,1
1151,Price was cheaper than Microsoft is selling it,1
1153,Great,1
1154,Seamless transaction at a great price!,1
1155,Works great,1
1156,Great price!!!!!,1
1157,Good deal for a yearly renewal of Office 365,1
1158,Much cheaper than in the stores,1
1159,A good price for a years use,1
1160,One very satisfied customer,1
1161,"The price, packaging and quality of the product all met my expectations",1
1162,And the delivery was on time,1
1163,"good price , received as stated",1
1164,Extended the one year subscription I had without a problem,1
1165,I like being able to have the latest versions available as I use both Mac and PC,1
1166,I used this to renew my annual subscription and it works just fine for that or for a new install,0
1167,"At $70, it is hard to beat",0
1168,I've heard many people complain about the new office suite,0
1169,"I understand it can be frustrating to change certain functions, but I think the improvements they have made speed up the usability immensely",0
1170,I've seen very few glitches - probably the worse is the occasional forced reboot,0
1171,"But even when that happens, the auto-save feature retains any changes I have made",0
1172,I haven't lost any data yet (which I can't say for older versions!),0
1173,BEWARE,-1
1174,NO WHERE WAS IT STATED THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE A 149,0
1175,99 PIECE OF SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO USE THIS PRODUCT,0
1176,IF IT WASN'T FOR SCHOOL I WOULD STAY THE F*CK AWAY FROM MICROSOFT AND THEIR NICKLE AND DIMING POLICIES,2
1177,I purchased this mainly for 1TB storage,0
1178,And added bonus of Office apps is definitely nice,1
1179,Works flawlessly on my iPhone and my PC,1
1180,"I uploaded all of my photos (100+GB), videos (200+ GB) and all of it is synced with my phone",1
1181,"It's also great to come home and having all of my photos I took with my phone already be on the computer!
Dropbox is OK, but for same price you only get storage and nothing else",1
1182,Google can't decide what they want to do with Google + and my main issue you can't see your pictures in a folder and easily copy them to your PC,0
1183,"With OneDrive you get a simple folder view on the PC and if you go through their website, you actually get a really good looking album view",0
1184,"After a recent update to OneDrive, you also get a really nice ability to create web albums and share them with people with just a few clicks",0
1185,Happy with the product and the delivery,1
1186,Has been very helpful,1
1187,Department is pleased with this item,1
1188,Not an US/English version,0
1189,Had a difficult time processing the license,-1
1190,You may want to consider  paying the little bit extra for the US version less frustration,0
1191,Great deal on a 5 PC renewal!  You can apply the code immediately unlike in year's past where you needed to wait until almost your exact subscription end date,1
1192,"Personally I'm pretty happy with the subscription model  My household is using the full Office suite on 4 computers and 3 tablets, 3 phones, plus 5TB of cloud storage and staying up to date for $100 or less seems like a pretty darn good deal to me",0
1193,"One complaint I have is that I can't choose to only install, say Word on a Windows tablet or control the install directory which makes it hard to use on my low-memory cheap Windows tablet toy",-1
1194,check out your purchase and activation code immediately!!!  i had problems activating my Office 365 and although it was past 30 days they did not try to help as I feel they may have sent me a product with an unusable activation code,0
1195,They were not helpful at all!!,-1
1196,Great service,1
1197,Great product,1
1198,Purchased for someone else,1
1199,"Easy way to install and share Office products (Word, Excel, Power Point, Access, etc)",1
1200,Delivered as expected,1
1201,"Card was in Spanish, but didn't make a difference, as the product key worked to activate the subscription",0
1202,Doesn't work; must call Microsoft--seriously a waste of my time--so busy I've yet to do it,-1
1203,Great product,1
1204,Good product,1
1205,"Good Deal, Shipped Fast, Installed on all my Computers and works Great",1
1206,AAA+++,1
1207,Necessary software for the business world,0
1208,It's a lot cheaper here than buying directly from Microsoft!,1
1209,Better than buying subscription renewal,1
1210,Good product,1
1211,Wasn't  Valid  for use in the United States,-1
1212,So far this has been exactly as advertised and great for our family,1
1213,Installed on 3 computers with no problems at all and everyone up and running in minutes,1
1214,Well done,1
1215,"It seems this code will not work to renew an existing subscription, only for creating a new account",-1
1216,"Wish I had known that, as I would not have purchased this",-1
1217,Microsoft tech support was not helpful at all resolving the problem,-1
1218,But I like the product and recommend it,1
1219,The ability to install Office on multiple devices in the same household is great,1
1220,Great purchase!  Easy download,1
1221,"So excited that I can work on documents, presentations and spreadsheets on the go with my laptop!",1
1222,Why pay full price when you can get the discount here?!  Love it,1
1223,worked like a charm,1
1224,so easy!  Will do this again for next year,1
1225,"Love the annual deal with 5 pc's, much better than the old way",1
1226,I do find it odd that it is cheaper to have the code mailed to you on a card vs,1
1227,"just getting it electronically, but I won't complain",1
1228,Key card arrived very quickly and included all programs advertised,1
1229,Included clear instructions on where to enter code to activate or extend an Office 365 subscription,1
1230,Program updates downloaded and all programs are working smoothly,1
1231,My expiration date extended automatically to the correct date in my account portal,1
1232,Smooth transaction - will buy again,1
1233,An incredible product,1
1234,Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have,1
1235,The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users,1
1236,That alone is worth $100 a year,1
1237,"You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection",1
1238,"Yet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets)",0
1239,This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office,0
1240,"For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done",1
1241,"Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way",0
1242,"If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products",0
1243,Office 365 protects you against that,0
1244,"It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever",0
1245,One last feature is the stackability of the subscription,0
1246,There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere,0
1247,Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80,0
1248,"You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions",0
1249,"Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription",0
1250,This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage,0
1251,"This is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included",1
1252,So happy to have this key card for use on my computers,1
1253,Hate that I have to pay for it -_-,-1
1254,Great product,1
1255,I still have not got this successfully activated! It has been very challenging,-1
1256,I have used Office Home 365 for going on 3 years and really like it,1
1257,The subscription cost is cheapest purchasing subscription cards from Amazon,1
1258,You can get subscriptions for 40% off this way,0
1259,Subscriptions allow installation on up to 5 computers (PC/MAC) and up to 5 phones or tablets,0
1260,And best all you get Microsoft OneDrive storage with a full 1TB storage for EACH of the 5 user accounts (5 computers),0
1261,The cost of a single stand-alone license is about $100 times 5 is $500,0
1262,Office updates every 3 to 4 years,0
1263,"At anywhere from $60 to $70 per year (or $90 from Microsoft) for a subscription, it is a no-brainer to see you will NEVER pay stand-alone fee for your software",0
1264,AND you get free updates & upgrades so long as you have your subscriptions,0
1265,Exactly what I was looking for and I love that I can control who is using the office as the administrator !,1
1266,"I got the Product Key as expected however when I attempted to set up Office 365, the set up asked to pick my country from a list box",0
1267,United States was not an option,-1
1268,"Per FAQs, if the country is not listed, the Product Key is not valid for that country",-1
1269,Returning this and going to a box store,-1
1270,received Office 365 in just a couple of days,0
1271,Works fine,1
1272,Works great,1
1273,"Just download software, enter unlock code and install in a few minutes",0
1274,All features work as advertised and cloud storage is great,1
1275,There was a lot of reluctance amongst old time MS Office users at the idea of 'renting' Office for an annual fee to Microsoft,0
1276,It felt like MS was trying to shore up into income stream by turning us into subscribers rather than traditional consumers (because they were and are),0
1277,"But if you consider this

365 comes with ALL the office products
365 gives you the very latest version of the office products at all times
365 gives you FIVE separate licenses for 5 computers or devices
365 gives each of your FIVE licensees 1 TB or OneDrive Storage
OneDrive Storage is fully integrated into Windows 8 & Windows 10",0
1278,It also works on iOS,0
1279,These features are neat in and of themselves,1
1280,I'd also argue it makes 365 a bit of a bargain,1
1281,Some might argue that owning Office would be cheaper over the long term but I'd have to disagree,0
1282,"5 licenses covering Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook etc",0
1283,run about $1000 or so,0
1284,And eventually you will want to upgrade - some people say you don't have to but as someone who has used Word and Excel since version 1,0
1285,I'd say most full-point version upgrades ARE worth it if you can afford it,0
1286,And with 365,0
1287,you've got it,1
1288,You can get a personal edition with 1 license for less,0
1289,Home editions can be found on sale for around $70 a year sometimes,0
1290,You can buy 4 of them and take care of ALL MS Office needs and your cloud storage for $280 for 4 years like I did,0
1291,I've had a long and sometimes troubled relationship with MS products dating back to the 80s,0
1292,"I think I've tasted the good, the bad, and the super ugly they've produced over the years and am hardly a cheerleader for them",0
1293,"But Office 365 is a decent value proposition, and there is still no real competition for MS Office IMO - so this is pretty much a no brainer",1
1294,I came from Office 2007,0
1295,The only reason I upgraded was because my financial software would no longer work if I did not update my office software,2
1296,I find it to be more changes then needed,-1
1297,Why fix what's not broken,-1
1298,"After I got all the various applications quick set icons applied, I found the PRINT steps a PITA! I don't care for the toolbar color to be the same as the doc",0
1299,"Why change the page display???

I've had trouble with it working with older docs or one's I've created macro's for",0
1300,"Basically had to rewrite the macros!

The nice thing I can say about it, is the cloud feature",0
1301,"It's nice to have access to all of my documents with the ease of cloud, but other apps could do this for me",1
1302,Next time I think I will just change my financial software!,1
1303,Good price good product,1
1304,was skeptical but the code arrived and worked fine,1
1305,Love office,1
1306,I used this to renew an existing Office 365 subscription and it worked fine,1
1307,I had to connect to a US based VPN to activate the product initially and again for renewal a year later,0
1308,It's not designed to be activated outside of the US,-1
1309,Once the activation is complete it can be downloaded and used without VPN access,1
1310,This key code will not extend your current subscription,0
1311,I spent an hour on the phone with Microsoft and never did get it installed,-1
1312,"Some of the programs can hang up or become slow to load, but all in all over 5 pcs its pretty good",-1
1313,"It's MS Office, what else can I say?  I am happy to have full suite access and the cloud storage",1
1314,Online access (limited) to apps is also useful,1
1315,More functional/coherent than OpenOffice and free office products I've tried,0
1316,"Normally it's not worth the price, but at $70 for a 5 user very worth it",2
1317,Great deal with the 1 TB of cloud storage,1
1318,Easy to install on multiple devices,1
1319,Works OK,1
1320,What choice do you have,0
1321,Better price than the promotional price offered in the stores when you buy a new computer!  Don't love the idea of a subscription but love the idea of always having the latest version,1
1322,OEM product as described,0
1323,realy good for student,1
1325,"Microsoft needs to come up with something lke this, with a good price for the rest of us",1
1326,Thank You,1
1327,Very handy,1
1328,"Very good, just what I needed",1
1329,This product is still not working on my PC after two calls to Microsoft it still is not functioning,-1
1331,No need to say anything more,0
1332,But I will,0
1333,Easy to download on multiple devices,1
1334,Great for family and friends to use,1
1335,work ok like the price,1
1336,"Priced right, arrived quickly, number went right in and activated",1
1337,What more could ask for!  Would definitely purchase again!,1
1338,"I do a lot of spreadsheet work, and a fair bit of  writing and editing",0
1339,"I tried using Open Office when I switched from a PC to a Mac, but I found myself irritated by a ton of little things that didn't work",-1
1340,"Do I love Microsoft? Not always, but when I take the time to make software work for me, I like it to offer me options that allow me to do exactly what I want it to",0
1341,"I find that Office does that, and I am very happy with the product",1
1342,"I also appreciate being able to use it on my old PC, as well as on my iPhone and IPad at no extra cost",0
1343,This was a very good deal (buy the Key Card and save yourself $13,1
1344,00) and I have had no difficulty adjusting to the minor differences from the PC version,0
1345,"In addition, there are some very good sites on the web that offer tips and shortcuts",1
1346,An excellent application for word processing and compiling spreadsheets,1
1347,Much better than Excel 2010,1
1348,"Product is fine, one seller is selling another product (typically free and downloadable) under the same label",1
1349,This should be corrected,0
1350,Seller is linked here: http://www,0
1351,amazon,0
1352,com/gp/aag/main/ref=olp_merch_name_1?ie=UTF8&asin=B009SPTUW2&isAmazonFulfilled=0&seller=A1T11PIXZK63OO,0
1353,great deal,1
1354,Great price and works as advertised,1
1355,"If you can wait for it to arrive in the mail, there is no reason not to buy this - you will save a third of the purchase price compared with the instant download",0
1356,Perfect!  Great customer service!,1
1357,Cheapest place to buy this item,1
1358,Comes with 1 Terabyte of club store for 1 year!,0
1359,Too much  for most users,0
1360,Bigger isn't better,0
1361,Too expensive,-1
1362,The key code was fine and registered the install,1
1363,Very happy with the price and functional access this gives my small home office,1
1364,"Great deal, saved a bit off the retail",1
1365,Arrived on time and key worked fine,1
1366,"I love having all mydevices running the same version but hate MS penchant for playing the ""hide the menus somewhere new and obscure"" game

I would pay extra if they would leave the menus alone!

Overall its a bit suggish, the plusses outweigh the minuses but not by a lot",1
1367,Very satisfied,1
1368,I did the yearly 5 license subscription,0
1369,Works perfect,1
1370,best deal so far,1
1371,"works perfect, easy to install",1
1372,Seems to be a scam,-1
1373,I got office 365 for universities 2 PCs or Macs,0
1374,I thought it might work because on the back of the package was a sticker labelled 'office 365 home premium 5 PCs or Macs',0
1375,When attempted to activate it did not work,-1
1376,I had to return it,-1
1377,Super easy to use and install!,1
1378,"I've been using Office for years, probably since it first arrived",0
1379,"I bought 365 because (1) it has an iPad version that allows the creation of documents on a mobile device and (2) that capability is supposedly integrated with OneDrive, the MS cloud storage offering",0
1380,"So you should be able to create a document on an iPad and store it either on the iPad or on OneDrive, where you get a free terrabyte of storage with your subscription",0
1381,"Alas, while Word and Excel work very well on a keyboard-equipped iPad, there's a big glitch with OneDrive",0
1382,Large numbers of users (including me) can't connect iPad Word or Excel directly to our OneDrive accounts,0
1383,So you can't create a document on the iPad and save it in your OneDrive account in one step,0
1384,"If all the threads on the MS Office 365 support page are right, this problem has been unsolved for months, and it's a deal-breaker for many people",0
1385,There's a work-around: Download the iPad OneDrive app from iTunes and open docs stored in the cloud from there,0
1386,"While that's OK for documents already created and saved in OneDrive, it's no help for docs you create on your iPad",0
1387,"You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud",0
1388,"That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!

Apart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well",-1
1389,"If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear",0
1390,"Having said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews",0
1391,"When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc",0
1392,") but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking",0
1393,That was a surprise and a great relief,1
1394,The opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office,0
1395,"Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document",0
1396,If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files,0
1397,"There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface",0
1398,It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it,1
1400,"all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers",0
1401,That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash,0
1402,"And oddly, I could get to the files in the cloud seamlessly from an iPhone, but not from an iPad",0
1403,"If I find a way to do that, I'll edit this review",0
1404,Less functional than Office 2003,0
1405,"Word projects take longer, business cards don't print correctly in publisher, etc",0
1406,A true downgrade,-1
1407,worked great for renewal,1
1408,Much cheaper than buying it though the Office Website,1
1409,I will be buying a few more over the next few months until I reach my 5 year limit,0
1410,There is amazing value here if you use Onedrive already,1
1411,You get unlimited online storage along with Office for 5 PC's along with your Mobile devices! It's crazy!,1
1412,GREAT,1
1413,Complete rubbish! I got this with an Acer aspire laptop and installed it,-1
1414,There is no shortcut and double clicking the file does nothing,0
1415,"All previous versions of Office have worked, but this is rubbish and the is no manual or proper instructions",0
1416,Microsoft had gone way downhill,-1
1417,"If you can come up with any alternative, get that instead",1
1418,Arrived quickly; easy to install,1
1419,Really a good product,1
1420,I mostly bought this for the unlimited cloud storage to back up all my files,0
1421,The Office products are a perk,1
1422,Nothing compares to the Office Suite,1
1423,I like it works great and really don't mind the annual fee,1
1424,I like having the extra storage and Skype time,1
1425,It is a great package,1
1426,The added 1 TB cloud storage is a major advantage,1
1427,The price is write,1
1428,The main draw back is that you can not use Access in the cloud,-1
1429,Access has to be installed on the computer you are using,0
1430,"All other component like Word, PowerPoint, Excel would work would you access your files in the cloud from any computer",0
1431,Very useful,1
1432,Worked as advertised; no issues,1
1433,MS Office is of course the best word processing & spreadsheet program,1
1434,It is Microsoft's best product,1
1435,Only complaint is that the Mac support lags behind Windows versions,-1
1436,Hopefully they update Office to level Office 13 also for Mac and then they would probably get 5 stars,2
1437,The price is a bit too high because you need to pay every month/ every year instead of the old one time payment,2
1438,This subscription key cost is much cheaper than the renewal rate offered by Microsoft,1
1439,"Received the product in less than a week after placing the order and it works just fine!

Background: I had a Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium trial version installed on my computers, and towards the end of the trial period I needed to decide whether or not to buy it from Microsoft or somewhere else",1
1440,"To purchase the annual subscription from Microsoft, it costs $99",0
1441,99 for one year or $9,0
1442,99 per month,0
1443,"Instead, found the key card on Amazon for $69",0
1444,"99 (for the mailing option, mind you the instant download option is still $99",0
1446,"If you can wait for 6-7 days, just order the PC/Mac Key card",0
1447,"Since I was purchasing the license from Amazon, to avoid getting billed by Microsoft in the meantime, I deactivated my license from my account on the Microsoft website",0
1448,"After the key card was delivered, all I had to do was login to my Microsoft account and update the subscription key",0
1449,It accepted it without any issues whatsoever,1
1450,"Also, when I tried to open up MS Word, it asked me for the subscription key and to activate the license which I did",0
1451,This process works for renewal as well,1
1452,"Note: If the office software keeps asking you to update the key even after activating the license, just reboot your computer",0
1453,That solved the problem for me,1
1454,The entire process took just 10 mins,1
1455,So go for it!,1
1456,On time and as advertised,1
1457,Thanks,1
1458,Good price and easy to install,1
1459,"Item delivered on time, was as described in the ad",1
1460,"Undoubtedly the cheapest and best way to buy Office right now, and with unlimited OneDrive storage being announced recently you get a LOT for your money",1
1461,I will buy another keycode like this in a year's time,1
1462,0 problems upgrading 3 computers so far,0
1464,1 a year old running windows 7 and previous version of office,0
1465,"The last one was a cheap walmart acer from 2 years ago, even that upgraded with no issues",0
1466,We have always owned our licenses but this 1 year 5 pack was a bargin so we went this route,1
1467,Good price,1
1468,Everything was great! Just as expected,1
1469,It's Microsoft office,1
1470,It does what is expected,1
1471,"But as usual, Microsoft has made changes to the user interface with no rational reason",1
1472,Some changes are good: i,1
1473,the ability to delete an email from the list of emails provided,0
1474,"Some not so good: the flat, dull, all-gray theme",2
1475,"If you are thinking about purchasing Office 365 so that you can turn your iPad into a serviceable work station, think again",-1
1476,The apps for iPad simply DO NOT WORK,-1
1477,"About one month after purchasing a year's subscription to Office 365, the ""share"" feature stopped working",-1
1478,This means I can't email or provide links to any of the documents I create on my iPad-- which pretty much makes the whole app worthless,-1
1479,"Normally, I would have simply contacted a tech support representative and had the problem resolved that next day",0
1480,That's what I've done with Apple and Amazon,0
1481,Even smaller online companies I've done business with have a quick and easy chat service that allows them to solve problems quickly,0
1482,"A company's accessibility says as much about its confidence in its product as the performance of the product, itself: if they've got nothing to hide and are truly committed to offering their customers the best possible experience, there's no reason for them NOT to be accessible",0
1483,So you can imagine my dismay when I discovered that microsoft tech support is totally and completely inaccessible,0
1484,"After searching the app's ""help"" feature with absolutely no success, after languishing on hold to chat with an online representative that wound up being outsourced and clueless, after digging through the FAQs, forums, and articles to no avail, I came to the sorry conclusion that I could not contact microsoft because it did not want to be found",0
1485,"This is a perfect example of a company that knew it was hawking garbage and, after having flung its refuse in my face, slipped gleefully into the shroud of the inter-web-- never to be seen or heard from again",0
1486,In short: Office 365 for iPad is a scam,-1
1487,I tried to delete and reload the apps with no success,-1
1488,I tried to work directly in word online with no success,-1
1489,I tried saving the documents to the onedrive and directly to the iPad with no success,-1
1490,"Copy and pasting what I've written into the body of an email undoes all of the formatting, and is therefore not a viable option",-1
1491,And before microsoft sends one of its cronies to comment on my review: YES,0
1492,I have absolutely provided the company with a direct comment/feedback on this situation,0
1493,I provided it nearly two months ago and have seen absolutely no change since,0
1494,"So, in utter desperation, I've been downloading all of the updates for the office apps as soon as they become available, hoping that one of them would finally solve the ""share"" problem for iPad",-1
1495,"But instead of improving the apps, the update has only made them worse",-1
1496,"Today's update completely got rid of the ""word count"" feature-- a very basic feature that I rely on to do my job-- and replaced it with some tool that allows me to see the document as a full page instead of the traditional view (",0
1498,"Now when I search ""word count,"" the help feature swears it doesn't exist, never existed",0
1499,And I don't have an extra hour to spend trying to communicate with an outsource technician,0
1500,So today is exactly the day that I decided to stop being nice and write this review,0
1501,"What we have in microsoft is a company so bloated and monopolized that it no longer cares about the woefully shoddy quality of its products, a company that has sold out to join the scam artist conglomerate of comcast and at&t",0
1502,"It's as if microsoft has a whole separate ""Ways to Piss Off Our Customers Thinktank"" department",0
1503,"I swear it does, because there's no possible way it could be more annoying, inefficient, and downright incompetent",-1
1504,"I know there was a lot of ranting in this review, but the takeaway should be this: if you're wanting to work on your iPad, look elsewhere",0
1505,"The Office 365 apps for iPad are buggy and disappointing, and I have zero confidence in microsoft to fix them anytime this decade",-1
1506,Had to weed through several websites to allow me to enter the key code,-1
1507,"When they state - ""Go to this particular website and enter your keycode"", why does that site never exist? Microsoft should have a dedicated site (as advertised) to address this install only",0
1508,Can't beat this price,1
1509,"Don't be misled - this is the full ""Professional"" HARD DRIVE-BASED version of the same MS Office (including Access and Publisher) you would pay $250-400 dollars for in hard media that cannot be renewed - just replaced with another $300 disk version",0
1510,"This is a subscription (annual purchase) program, and is a steal even at the $99 annual price compared to getting a one-time inflated price disk you will be replacing in 2-3 years anyhow when MS pulls support of the product",1
1511,plus you get oodles of free cloud space and Skype minutes every month in addition!  Don't pass up this deal!  I was leery but am not at all disappointed I enrolled in the annual purchase program vs,0
1512,"re-purchasing MS Office every few years, or working with an outdated, unsupported version of the suite",-1
1513,Easy to install on all of our computers/laptops and I feel the price was right for the number of systems this can be installed on,0
1514,"I'm a pretty experienced Office user, but there are not enough negative words for me to describe this product",1
1515,"It's cumbersome, unfriendly, apparently only works on Explorer",-1
1516,It is *not* the same as the regular Office product,-1
1517,"It seemed like a good idea when I purchased it, but completely regret that decision",2
1518,Awesome that I can have this one product to install on all my devices and always have the most up to date version,1
1519,Pretty basic,0
1520,Subscription to Office 365,1
1521,"Software is high quality and prices are dropping on MS software, so 4 stars!",1
1522,Great deal now that they include unlimited OneDrive storage,1
1523,"Fast shipping, Works great, would recommend or purchase again",1
1524,"Needed to buy this to allow me to load Office on my portable device as well as my desktop,  I wish Microsoft allowed multiple installations, like up to 3 at least without spending any more money",2
1525,Something went terribly wrong at Microsoft in 2011-2012,-1
1526,"Predicting that the entire globe would soon be replacing their desktops with touchscreen devices and monitors, Microsoft began designing its software with those users in mind",0
1527,"The best example, of course, is Windows 8, which welded together the traditional desktop experience with a metro UI that was minimally useful to desktop users focused on mouse-and-keyboard productivity",0
1528,"After a deluge of criticism, much of it deserved, Microsoft backtracked and began releasing updates to the OS that reintroduced features and options more suited to the desktop user (like the ability to boot straight to the desktop)",0
1530,"1 was a big step in the right direction for those of us who use our computers for work rather than play, and Windows 10 promises to be an even bigger leap",0
1531,"The problem is, Office 2013 -- which is the Office version that currently comes with the Office 365 subscription -- has the same problem as the initial Windows 8",0
1532,"Regardless of what the spokespeople at Microsoft will say, this office suite was designed with tablet users in mind",0
1533,"On a tablet, the Office 2013 experience is excellent, even elegantly simple and beautiful",0
1534,"Great new features, like synching office settings across multiple devices and greater integration with the OneDrive cloud (a service that I'm a huge fan of), add value",0
1535,"On a desktop, however, it delivers the equivalent of the experience that the metro interface of Windows 8 did",0
1536,All of its aesthetic design strengths become weaknesses on a 22 inch non-touch monitor,0
1537,"It just seems clunky, out of place, and half baked",-1
1538,The first thing professional users will notice is that there is an awful lot of white space in Outlook,-1
1539,Things just seem bigger,0
1540,And it's no accident: the scaling of the software was designed with high-dpi screens (like tablets) in mind,0
1541,"When using Outlook on a normal desktop monitor, you end up reading emails where the name of the sender is an unnaturally large font size",0
1542,"The calendar is no longer visible in the main inbox display, instead replaced by more white space and the aforementioned large font (again, something that makes sense on a higher-dpi display)",-1
1543,"In other words, everything seems out of proportion",-1
1544,Let me rephrase that -- everything IS out of proportion,0
1545,What is worse is the rendering of the fonts,-1
1546,Although this is a problem that actually occurs on all of MS's native application programs in Windows 8,0
1547,"X, it is particularly annoying with Word",0
1548,"After all, I can easily install a different web browser to bypass Internet Explorer, but MS Word is a different beast entirely",0
1549,"In geek language, what MS did was opt to use grayscale font aliasing in these programs instead of the RGB font rendering of its older API",0
1550,"The result, once more, is a great experience on a tablet",0
1551,On a desktop? Fonts seem just a tad blurry or hazy,0
1552,Basically the result is that Office 2013 on a desktop gives you the same font experience you would have had if you had ever deselected the ClearType option on any sort of LCD panel running Windows in the 2000s,0
1553,"What to say about this piece of software then? Well, I uninstalled Office 2013 and reinstalled my old Office 2010",-1
1554,"The problem with 2013 isn't that it does away with the Aeroglass appearance, which I like but am not particularly committed to",-1
1555,My problem is that it does away with it for all the wrong reasons: to create a better experience for tablet users,0
1556,"Yet the people most likely so sit down and work for extended periods of time with MS productivity software - like Office - are likely to be those NOT working on tablets, but instead working on good ol' fashioned mouse-and-keyboard systems",0
1557,MS is fixing its mistakes with Windows 8,0
1558,"It's time they start doing the same with Office 2013, which seems to be fossilizing the mistakes that Windows 8 eliminated over a year ago",0
1559,"Until it does, I am sticking with Office 2010",0
1560,"EDIT: I wanted to update this to account for the fact that I have tried out Office 2016, and it has the exact same font issue that Office 2013 had",0
1561,"So if you subscribe to MS Office 365, and you have a nice desktop monitor, you'll be experiencing the same antedeluvian font rendering effects",0
1562,Terrible,-1
1563,"Wake up, Microsoft",-1
1564,Don't do it!!!  This is a horrible product,-1
1565,"It slows your computer WAYYYYYYY DOWN!  The only thing I did like about it was the ""one drive"" option to have files saved to the cloud, but there are many other options for that (including purchasing space on Amazon's cloud)",-1
1566,Luckily I kept an older version of Office on my computer so I could actually get some work done,0
1567,"But as noted previously, it's hard to actually find a way to GET to tech support let alone actually get an answer",0
1568,"I gave one of the subscriptions to a team member since I had 5 subscriptions to use, she was smart enough to read the reviews so she didn't even load it",0
1569,Seriously Microsoft,-1
1570,why would I want to buy something that REDUCES my productivity????  I should send you a bill for all the time I wasted on this item,0
1572,I chose to buy Microsoft because I can claim it every year on my taxes anyways,0
1573,It's as expected out of Microsoft products; can't complain about anything,1
1574,"It's a bonus to be able to share between devices, BUT I regret using onedrive to do so because it's not exactly syncing like Dropbox - but onedrive sure gives a whole lot more storage space",1
1575,"You win some, you lose some",0
1576,Great product and a great price,1
1577,Easy to use Key card,1
1578,Very quick delivery and as described,1
1579,I was very pleased with the product,1
1580,Came exactly as described,1
1581,Thank you,1
1582,Great,1
1583,Best price,1
1584,Good deal -- all good,1
1585,A great bargain for up to 5 computers,1
1586,The item did not satisfy my need,-1
1587,Shipped fast,1
1588,Exactly as expected,1
1589,"It runs a little slower than my old Office 2003, but it has some nice features",2
1590,"Contrary to popular myths, this product does run without an internet connection and gives you full product capability",1
1591,"It does require an internet connection once a month to validate that the license is still valid, but that is the only online requirement",2
1592,It is actually Office 2013 packaged with some online Onedrive storage and other online capabilities,1
1593,You also have the choice of where you want to store your data - either on your local PC or on the cloud,0
1594,I have Office 365 through my company,0
1595,It has a depressing look,-1
1596,"I can understand they want consistency while in a tablet, that can't have the bezels, etc",0
1597,But I am not on a tablet,0
1598,"I want the colors, bezels and everything that made Outlook 2010 or 2007 or 2003 more clear back",0
1599,"I really is much less of a joy working with the dull, low-power-tablet HTML5 oriented horrible interface",0
1600,Listen to customers,0
1601,A company as wealthy must be careful when customer speak,0
1602,It worked and all is good!!,1
1603,Key card is a great way to renew the Office 365 subscription and save money compared to renewing directly over the web,0
1604,I love it,1
1605,It was easy to install and use,1
1606,Great price,1
1607,Here's to another year of Office 365!,1
1608,"IMPORTANT INFO!  Though it says it is for PC and MAC, Publisher and Access DO NOT WORK on Mac's",0
1609,They should make this clear on the page,0
1610,This is deceptive advertising by Microsoft,-1
1611,I called Microsoft Support and they confirmed this is true,0
1612,"I was looking to buy this to use Publisher on my Mac, but now that I know it will not work, I will just stick with my old version of Office for Mac",0
1613,Though I wonder what else Microsoft isn't telling us,0
1614,I like,1
1615,It takes a little getting used too,0
1616,Arrived on time and no problem installing,1
1617,So far has worked for me,1
1618,Did not experience activation problems,1
1619,Appears parallel to Office 2013 installed on my other laptop,0
1620,"Main complaint: WHY?? After more than a decade, I've always looked for my orange Outlook icon",-1
1621,"WHY did they change the color?? Also, was there something wrong with the ""Contacts"" folder in Outlook? Was it necessary to rename it to ""People""?

Other than that it's ""slicker"" and runs a little faster than previous versions, but still has bugs",0
1622,"Thankfully the bugs don't make me hate it :) and the rest of the ""improvements"" are actually improved",1
1623,(Especially the lower price for the subscription-based purchase - makes it easier to not pirate the software),0
1624,Great,1
1625,Really I got office 2011,0
1626,not the latest version of office,0
1627,with my Mac,0
1628,that is just horrible,-1
1629,If I knew I would only get office 2011 I wouldn't have even bought this,-1
1630,The reason why I even got this was because I wanted to brush up on my excel 2013,0
1631,Microsoft this is the reason why I stopped using your products after 15 years of loyal service,-1
1632,you just keep finding ways to disappoint me,-1
1633,"If you didn't have to share your password with Microsoft, this would be great",0
1634,Office 365,0
1635,Cheaper than buying directly,0
1636,It offers the suite of Microsoft products for a yearly price,1
1637,Buy if you plan on not using Office for that long,0
1638,If you need a regular copy then I would recommend Office 2010 or 2013 Home and Business,0
1639,Which includes Outlook,0
1640,"yep, it's cloud based & works well over all my gadgets",0
1641,This appears to be one of the cheaper ways to renew your Office 365 subscription,0
1642,"This small pack is posted to you, with a Microsoft Office 365 Serial Number",0
1643,This can be used as a new stand alone installation or to renew your last years subscription,0
1644,Works seamlessly,1
1645,Works great and easy to activate,1
1646,I've been a long time Microsoft Office user,1
1647,This in my mind is the best release so far,0
1648,"It's quick, intuitive, and I love how it saves to OneDrive where I can get to any of my documents from any of my devices",1
1649,"Initially, I wasn't sure how it would work on my iPad but after editing some Word documents, I'm very impressed how easily it was to transition from my PC to my iPad",0
1650,Excellent and the price is reasonable,1
1651,Works great and easy to install,1
1652,Just follow the instructions,0
1653,"The only thing you do in put in the Product Key, after you go to www",0
1656,Then follow the link to www,0
1659,is ok,1
1660,Great product! Love that I was able to get it for a bargain on Amazon too,1
1661,Great and easy to work with,1
1662,Easy to install/update,1
1663,Would highly recommend this for anyone needing all that Microsoft has to offer as it is better than the Student version and no different in price,1
1664,It installs on up to 5 personal PC's and 5 Ipads or compatible devices,0
1665,"I already had word, excel, PowerPoint & Onenote on my iPad from my business, so all I did was log out and log in to my iPad with my Microsoft account and it didn't use one of my iPad subscriptions",0
1666,"So download the apps first then log in, why waste one of the key codes if you don't need to",0
1667,It may tell you that its not compatible with the iPad but it is,0
1668,"If you need access any document save it to to your onedrive, and you can access on the go from any Internet",0
1669,Its like having all that you may need while not in front of you,0
1670,Last I looked Microsoft sells it for twice the price online and in retail stores,0
1671,"It does require a renewal at the end of your year, so you can choose to auto renew and enter credit card or Microsoft will send you an email when its time to renew",0
1672,"Also, if you need to put it on another PC just deactivate one by logging in to your Microsoft account you can add it to another PC but this can only be done once every 90 days",0
1673,"So let's say you have it on a personal PC that your child is using for college and they no longer need it, deactivate it and you have another one to use on another PC",0
1674,Just what my household needed and at a lower price,1
1675,Thank you,1
1676,"Office 365 fits all of my expectation for Microsoft Office, and it will download on 5 devices",1
1677,I wouldn't choose anything else,1
1678,Perfect,1
1679,So awesome  no complaints,1
1680,"This is not a review of Office 365, but of the 1 year subscription key card",0
1681,Be careful with purchasing this,-1
1682,"I paid Microsoft for a 1 month subscription of Office 365 Home Premium, then purchased one of these 1 year subscription cards to extend my subscription for another year",0
1683,That didn't work out as planned,-1
1684,I signed up for 1 month of Office 365 on 8/23/2014 with an expiration date of 9/23/2014,0
1685,I applied this key card on 9/6/2014 and it showed an expiration date of 10/5/2015,0
1686,What the heck?! Shouldn't it extend my subscription until 10/23/2015??? The short answer is NO,-1
1687,I contacted Microsoft support and had a very long chat with an agent before discovering that the key card I purchased was for a 1 year free TRIAL of Office 365,0
1688,"I had already purchased a 1 month subscription, and then started a TRIAL that would run concurrently with my paid subscription",0
1689,The TRIAL does not extend a subscription,-1
1690,"I reviewed the listing on Amazon and the packaging of the key card and did not find any indication that what I had purchased was a repacked TRIAL of Office 365, but that's what it is",0
1691,"This key card probably works fine on its own if you're new to Office, but beware if you're looking to extend a subscription",0
1692,I'm double paying for 17 days of my subscription and Microsoft wouldn't do me a solid and extend my subscription a couple of weeks,0
1693,MS Office subscription model is good,1
1694,5 PC license is also good for families,1
1695,"However, Microsoft, I will not buy subscription to your OS",-1
1696,The day OS becomes a subscription is the day I will dump MS completely (including Office),-1
1697,Exactly as described!,1
1698,"Shipped on time and was easy to install, Hope my grandkids can teach me how to use it",1
1699,I bought this so that I could add it to other computers,0
1700,For some reason this will not work,-1
1701,This is very disappointing,-1
1702,Not worth it!,-1
1703,I am writing this to warn people about one major issue,-1
1704,The IDEA of having copies of office on multiple computers and saving your files to one drive is terrific,0
1705,"With that, you don't have to remember which computer has which document",-1
1706,"If you are working on something large, like a book, you can work on it at whichever computer is available",0
1707,This is a tremendous potential benefit,0
1708,The current execution of that idea can be a nightmare,-1
1709,"I cannot tell you how many times I have had to sort out which version is my current version, and which version was the previous version",0
1710,"After using this software for hours at a time most days over 5 months, I still find it difficult to know the correct answer when I open a document and face the dreaded question ""Which do you want to keep? Keep server version, or Keep My version""",0
1711,Apparently one of those didn't get my changes,-1
1712,Just yesterday I saved a document which appeared to both save and upload correctly,0
1713,Then this morning I was faced with the dreaded question,-1
1714,"As both saving locally appeared to work, as well as uploading, shouldn't they both have my changes? I chose ""Keep my version"", since saving locally seemed more likely to have succeeded",0
1715,Wrong! All my changes were gone,-1
1716,"Ironically, they really had been uploaded, as I could find the changes in the previous version on the onedrive website",0
1717,Writing something like a book this sort of issue can be dramatically more painful,-1
1718,"What if the last time you touched it (a week ago) you made important but key updates in a few places, but you don't recall what they were anymore? Then you have to download both versions and use compare documents just to avoid accidentally trashing all those changes",0
1719,Great price!,1
1720,Paid a great price through the seller,1
1721,Installs quick,1
1722,Works like you expect office to work,1
1723,"Bought it from Amazon, keeps saying The product is not intended for your identified region when I try to install",0
1724,"I struggled with the idea of a  subscription based Office program, overall I could not be happier",1
1725,"You get the latest and greatest program, to use on 5 machines, and 5 Microsoft accounts now get 1TB of OneDrive space, I have a lot of files, but 1TB covers all I need, then I have it all everywhere",0
1726,Good,1
1727,The key I received had already been activated on 11/3/2013,0
1728,Seems like a scam to me,-1
1729,Good software thanks,1
1730,Nice deal easy to use,1
1731,best angle for an office 365 subscription,1
1732,Great Price & 5 devices! pretty easy either put the code in word where it asks or download fresh version from Microsoft,1
1734,Great product at a great price,1
1735,Highly recommend,1
1736,Good,1
1737,"It's office, a necessary evil of bloatware",-1
1738,This is just an activation key #,0
1739,The one I received was still shrink wrapped and the code activated with Microsoft,2
1740,"Great item, fast shipment, thank you!",1
1741,it was not easy to get installed,-1
1742,I have to involve Microsoft and my country was not listed as country to use this office 365 home key card,0
1743,If I did not have the privous office installed it would be a big issue,0
1744,Works as Advertised,1
1745,Great product has everything I need,1
1746,Easy-to-use,1
1747,Would buy again,1
1748,Just as advertised,1
1749,"My existing software was in need of an update, and Office 365 has done exactly that",1
1750,"While I experienced some challenge in downloading this particular package, the tech staff at M/S were very helpful, and all is well",2
1751,Simple easy to apply and the best deal on Office 365 I have seen,1
1752,A little known secret is that you can buy several and apply them immediately for a multi-year subscription period with rate locked in to this price,0
1753,"Had STRONG reservations about the ""Subscription"" method for any software, let alone a Microsoft product",0
1754,"However, the price seemed right ($64), at least for the first year, and it allowed me to load MS Office on five computers",0
1755,So I leaped into the parade,0
1756,"Well, let me say that this system is what computers were designed for! I installed Office on my wife's computer and then on mine",0
1757,"The ""OneDrive"" feature allows me to transfer files back and forth between our computers easily",0
1758,"Before this, I would network a file and save it to her desktop",0
1759,Using OneDrive seems more efficient,1
1760,Then I installed the MS Office Mobil app on our Samsung Smart phones,0
1761,The app is free and gives us access to anything we put on OneDrive,1
1762,"The Office app, however, cannot be installed in my wife's ASUS tablet (purchased from Amazon, of course)",-1
1763,But I was able to install OneDrive on the ASUS and Word docs can be opened using the Polaris app (just not the one for tablets - go figure),-1
1764,"So now, thanks to Office 365, we have access to any files we want to access (and so does the whole world, to be sure)",1
1765,And I still have three more installations to go,0
1766,"Office 365 has received some negative reviews, but for my purpose it works great!",2
1767,The product key card works like a charm--entered it in the middle of the trial and we got one year and a month! The idea that support never expires and that we'll always have the most current edition of such a staple works for us,0
1768,wish they had the disk instead,-1
1769,Easy to install,1
1770,It was exactly what I was expecting and what I needed!,0
1771,"Buying one Office package that upgrades and updated my five computers, including my daughter's Mac, great!  Then you throw in an hour of free international Skype per month with relatives overseas, it is truly great",0
1772,"And, then there is the 1TB of memory in the Cloud",0
1773,"Having a windows phone, I'm all in",0
1774,works fantastic with my Mac and my MacBook Pro,1
1775,the only draw back is the clip art is not like Microsoft windows,-1
1776,Other than that it is fantastic,2
1777,Most of us just need it for any type of work! I just hate having to purchase this EVERY year!,0
1778,What you're buying is a code number that extends your Office 365 Home subscription for a year,0
1779,Getting it at the best price from a reliable source is definitely the way to go!,1
1780,"Not only do you get the greatness of the full Office suite, you now get 1 TB of online Onedrive storage",0
1781,"****NOTE: If you want to skip the long version, jump to the bottom for a short summary",0
1782,"****

****Long Version****
My wife and are are busy professionals with very different schedules",0
1783,We've come to see time as a valuable commodity and needed to have a calendar experience that could be shared across all of our devices,0
1784,"We were both very familiar with Outlook, so we researched Office 365",1
1785,"Given the cloud functionality, OneDrive with 1TB each, and regular updates to the newest versions, it seemed like the best option for us",0
1786,I use a PC at home and a ThinkPad for work when I travel,0
1787,She uses a Macbook Air and an iMac,0
1788,Little did we know that Microsoft has decided to stop supporting (or at least poorly support) their Mac products,0
1789,"I received the product key in the mail, started it up, and downloaded everything into my PC first",0
1790,I set up both of our webapp accounts and shared some calendars,0
1791,I then started working on her iMac next,0
1792,This is where I ran into a problem,0
1793,"After a couple hours of trying, I just could not find a way to cloudshare anything between my PC, our webapps, and her Outlook account",0
1794,I figured that it was some problem on my end,0
1795,"I'm used to troubleshooting things, so I started working on it",2
1796,"After spending another 3-4 hours on it myself unsuccessfully, I finally decided to contact Microsoft",-1
1797,Know that I fully updated everything and explored the online tech support,0
1798,"First, I was directed by an online chat tech to the phone support line",0
1799,"There, I was told that they NO LONGER have a tech support phone line",-1
1800,"That's right, if you buy a Microsoft product for your Apple products, you are a second class citizen",-1
1801,"You no long have access to a live person!

As for what Mac tech support was available, she first directed me to a site that no longer worked",0
1802,"When I explained this, she carefully spelled it out again (as if I couldn't figure it out), then seemed surprised it still didn't work",0
1803,"She had to troubleshoot this, before finally finding the NEW Mac support site",0
1804,The new site mostly contained things I had already found,0
1805,Microsoft basically continued to lead me to believe that there was some way to make all of this work between a Mac and a PC,0
1806,"Eventually, I had to go to the community forums",0
1807,"After about an hour of searching there, I discovered that there is no way to do what the product says it does",0
1808,Office 365 CANNOT share with iMacs or Macbooks,-1
1809,"You get an older, outdated product that somehow is advertised as ""new",-1
1810,""" Basically, its Office 2011 for Mac, which we already purchased for her three years ago! The WHOLE REASON we bought Office 365 to begin with was to have products that could work together among my Windows PC and Thinkpad and her iMac and Macbook

This borders on false advertising",0
1811,"Its appalling that there is no explanation of this anywhere, not even on the Microsoft website",0
1812,They do not tell their support team this and I doubt their sales team knows either,0
1813,"After some searching, I did find out that we could spend additional money ($4 a month) to own our own Exchange account to make this work",0
1814,That is the only way,0
1815,"I'm debating just biting the bullet, but it would make me more angry to let them extort more money out of money to use an inferior product that I already paid for previously",0
1816,"****SUMMARY****
Macs get an inferior product from four years ago as a part of Office 365 that has no cloud functionality",0
1817,"If you want to do what Office 365 says it does, with Macs AND PCs, you need to pay more money ($4 a month) to rent your own exchange server for each person with a Mac account",0
1818,"Thus, this will cost you at least $196 a year, rather than the $100 Office365 advertises",0
1819,"Basically, THIS DOES NOT SHARE WITH MACS",0
1820,"As an early adopter, I was pretty thrilled to try out Office 365 on my iPad",0
1821,I used it for about a week,0
1822,I haven't used it since,0
1823,"While they did an excellent job nailing the interface on iOS, there are a lot of features that are missing",0
1824,"Drawing tables in Word, for instance, is nowhere near as robust as what's found on the desktop",0
1825,"So designing something like a wireframe or a newsletter is very difficult, if not impossible",0
1826,"Otherwise, Office 365 is the same Office we've all grown to love and hate over the years",0
1827,And the subscription model is great,1
1828,I'd be pretty upset with myself if I'd plunked down several hundred dollars for this software,-1
1829,Excellent!,1
1830,"I have this product on my home computer, work computer, and my phone",1
1831,Great! I love it and will be reupping it next year!,1
1832,Bought to renew my subscription,0
1833,Worth waiting a couple of days to save money!,1
1834,This product is not intended for your identified region,-1
1835,Please contact support for help,0
1836,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome , Oh,  Did i I say how awesome this product is",1
1837,"I have this installed Office 365 on my main desktop ,and all users of my desktop (Wife, Guest) can use the software",0
1838,"I can also then install on a tablet ,  still  only counts as 1 install",0
1839,I shared with 4 other that can  install on their desktop and tablets,0
1840,"All  main users get 1 TB of Free storage that alone is huge but we also all get  Word, Excel, Power point, One Note,  Publisher, Access & 60 min of Skype",0
1841,This has been of the best services I pay for on a yearly basis,1
1842,If there is a better bang for the buck I would  love to hear it,1
1843,The price alone for 1tb of cloud storage (accessible on almost any device) beats any service that I have used,1
1844,I would HIGHLY recommend office 365 to anyone without hesitation,1
1845,This is a great value and a really good product,1
1846,It now comes with 1 TB of onedrive storage,0
1847,That is more than many of you have in your ultra books and other flash based devices such as tablets and phones for sure,0
1848,One note is really good,1
1849,WHY TO WAIT FOR THIS IT WOULD BE BETTER DOWNLOAD DIRECTLY,1
1850,"I first purchased this product at Best By, but TWICE I had to return the key because it wasn't activated properly by them",1
1851,I purchased it on Amazon for 40% less and the key worked the very first time! The only reason I took away a star is because the install took a few tries,1
1852,"I installed it on two computers, both new computers with Windows 7, and both times I had to restart the computer and start the install over before the installed properly",0
1853,The subscription key was easy to activate,1
1854,Sharing the subscription with others in my household was a little cumbersome,0
1855,this is a good product,1
1856,It works as described,1
1857,"I was suppose to be able to use it on up to five computers, it worked on one and locked up",2
1858,"This is great , the office365 home was easy to use and get my started quickly",1
1859,Amazon was very speedy with get my key card to me in great time,1
1860,Not bad; better than nothing; or going to the library,2
1861,I have rarely had any problems with Microsoft products,1
1862,This was easy to install and I was up and running again in no time,1
1863,Works well and as expected,1
1864,Worked like a charm!,1
1865,Received product on time and the card worked as advertised,1
1866,Cannot live without it!,1
1867,Great value!  Installed just fine,1
1868,Being able to load onto five separate PCs via a subscription service is a winner,1
1869,"I love this product, it was easy to install, arrived faster than expected and the price was great, and I was able to installed it on my laptop and my desktop",1
1870,Have used this product before and great for everyday use,1
1871,Would recommend to everybody including students and price is right,1
1872,"Great product, kids need it for school and a lot of other programs are not as user friendly! Thank you!",1
1873,"So, even though there are alternatives, for business purposes, I prefer to have something I can count on working during a source document exchange",1
1874,"The price is significantly less than from Microsoft, and they just upped the amount of sky drive storage you get",1
1875,"Good for 5 users / devices, so its actually a bargain",1
1876,"A part from the slight problem installing, and the fact that I have had a hard time sharing with my other e-mail accout",1
1877,This is a great product,1
1878,"The customer service helped me do the initial installation, since it wasn't recognizing me",1
1879,"It took a bit, but the customer service was very helpful and patient with the situation",2
1880,"Programs themselves, I have not yet used all of them, but my husband loves how rapid they work",0
1881,I purchased the key on April 17th great deal,0
1882,I had to refresh my computer because of software problems and now the key doesn't work and microsoft says it is invalid,0
1883,Not Happy!!,-1
1884,"Not a big fan of Microsoft's selling of beta products, where you have to find where the bugs are on your own and hope Microsoft will release a fix",0
1885,My College requires purchase over allowing for free based products to be used in classes,0
1886,"So far, so good",1
1887,The real challenge is going to come when it's time to renew,0
1888,I can recall paying $399 for the full boxed version of MS Office and not activating it back when we had the choice,0
1889,I went six or seven months before I'd opened MS Word 50 times and the program forced me to activate,0
1890,"The expense breaks down less expensive this way, (so far)",0
1891,"All of the office functions word as expected, but the Outlook function really needs some serious help",0
1892,"The Outlook mail is what I would call very messy and could be a lot better served it Microsoft just worried about making it clean like Office 2007, not a lot of bells and whistles which just get in the way of receiving emails without guessing which menu or button to select next",0
1893,I would say to any person interested in using Office 365 to stick with the software that is straight forward and easy to use,0
1894,"Keep your Office 2007, or 2010 and wait until Microsoft get their act together",0
1895,Installed very easily and seems to work fine,1
1896,It will be nice to have office on my pc/mac and tablet and phones,1
1897,Definitely a cheap option compared to Microsoft,1
1898,"com, but be aware: the subscription can only be activated from within the us or Canada",0
1899,"Anywhere else, and it does not allow you to activate it",0
1900,"Had to wait for a while to use it, since I was abroad for the time",1
1901,This is the second year of Office 365 for us,0
1902,"We use it a lot, and teach Word and Excel in our community center",0
1903,This is the easiest and cheapest way I know of to keep up to date with Office,1
1904,Unusable because it is for a different region,-1
1905,So I am out $66,0
1906,I wish I wouldn't have bought this item,-1
1907,This product is just a card with a product key on it,0
1908,"This has led to so much more ease with installation and management across various home computers, as you just need to sign into a site to download and manage Office",1
1909,"At the time I got it ($67), it was also a clear winner above the traditional licensing model, though you will have to get a spreadsheet and do the calculation for yourself",0
1910,I bought my wife a new laptop and decided on Office 365 instead of a Suite,0
1911,"The fact that I can share it to 5 platforms is great, I immediately sent it to her iPad and mine",0
1912,The fact that new software updates just get incorporated rather than having old Office versions to replace was the key factor,0
1913,I looked into that thoroughly before purchasing the trial,0
1914,"THEN, I read about the Key Card extension savings and came over to Amazon to try it out",0
1915,I just added a year of 365 for $72 which comes to $6 per month,0
1916,The instructions on the description page were perfect and I entered the code in about 45 seconds,0
1917,Great!,1
1918,Office 365 is IMHO the best way to have current ms office capability,1
1919,"Yes Google docs,  and various free constructions are very good",1
1920,"But if you even sometimes need to deal with real ms office files, this will save time and frustration",0
1921,One license for all my computers,0
1922,"5 computers, one user",0
1923,So install on wife's box as you,0
1924,Not one license each,0
1925,1st bought in 2013,0
1926,"Used on 3 desktop pc's, 2 laptop pc's and 2 smart phones",0
1927,1 year subscription for 5 computers,0
1928,"Both time purchased for $80, so $1",0
1929,33 per month per device not counting smart phones,0
1930,We use it enough just for documents to be worthwhile,0
1931,Easy to store work online or any of the devices,0
1932,Never have tried any other document software as most business's I deal with run Office,0
1933,"I like the automatic updates, tutorials and support that comes with this purchase",1
1934,Everything as it should be,1
1935,Original packaging with card,0
1936,This will be the future of software where everything is subscription,1
1937,Using the link on the back of the card you can not only register but download the programs EASILY,0
1938,You do not have to pay extra to be able to download the programs,0
1939,Plus you do not have register a CC card at MS as you would have to do with a trial,0
1940,So a subscription card (which is cheaper) is no different than buying a download/subscription,0
1941,TIP - before you start create a MS account at if you already do not have one (like XBOX or Windows)  before you start so you can get that out of the way,0
1942,It will send you an email to verify the email address you used,0
1943,Then follow the instructions on the back of the card,0
1944,And DO NOT get a trial first,-1
1945,"The only issue with the trial is that now MS has  CC on file for you, something you may not want",-1
1946,Finally bit the bullet and upgraded to the subscription Office,0
1947,Have owned Office 2007 since 2007,1
1948,"2007 was a good reliable system, but started having an issue where my Outlook Calendar stopped maintaining appointment notifications",0
1949,After failing to fix the 2007 issue I bought a $68 a year subscription at Amazon which seems about the right price point for the typical home user,0
1950,Hopefully as time passes this price point will be available,0
1951,Have only had the 365 installed a few days,0
1952,"That being said here is my take:

1",0
1953,"Have four computers I installed on, three Windows 8",0
1954,1 and one Windows 7,0
1955,All installations went exceedingly smoothly with 2007 installed,0
1956,Picked up my settings especially email settings with out having to dink under the hood,0
1958,"Only one issue during the installation, one of my Windows 8",-1
1959,1 computers had an issue where (I believe) Microsoft uploaded an older version of 365 to my machine and I had to get a tech to fix the issue,0
1960,About 30 minutes to fix from start of call to resolution,0
1962,System is certainly faster (a lot) than 2007 and easy enough to transition over to the new version,0
1963,"As mentioned, if $68 is the price point I believe this is a no brainer buy for the typical home user",0
1964,$99 a year seems steep seeing how you will continually have to purchase yearly subscriptions,0
1965,I ordered this item after my MS Office was due to be renewed,0
1966,I got the package delivered on the date which was specified when I placed the order,0
1967,Although I had an issue with the re-activation of my subscription (which was no fault of the seller) they were very instrumental in the help that they provided me with the dealing with this problem,0
1968,"I must admit that I felt really significant, confident and connected as the communication until the problem was rectified was great",1
1969,"I recommend that you make this tech store your number one choice as I was given excellent customer service and being a supervisor in a customer based industry, I was really impressed",1
1970,Great Job,1
1971,Kudos,1
1972,"I bought it mainly to have MS Office applications on my iPad, although I have not used it extensively yet, I like what I see",1
1973,The applications are well designed for iOS touch interface,1
1974,Worked perfectly,1
1975,I really like the new office 365,1
1976,You can sign up with this key and give access to a total of 5 family members (including yourself),1
1977,Each user also gets 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage space,1
1978,Couldn't ask for more given the price is so much less than the subscription direct through Microsoft,1
1979,I bought this product as with the 20 GB Skydrive + 60 mins Skype mins this appeared to be a good deal,0
1980,But the Skype meeting is not for all countries,-1
1981,"So, in case the Skype minutes are a deal breaker for you then check whether your country is listed before you buy this",0
1982,"For the countries that are listed, I am unable to call on cell phones thru skype, so I believe the subscirption only allows you to call landlines and not cell phones",0
1983,"Very helpful--easy to install, easy to use, no problems with using this product to date",1
1984,"Same system as my computer at work, so this is very helpful when opening work documents at home",0
1985,This is the first time I purchased a product and I only received a key card,1
1986,There are so many steps when downloading the program one can easily get frustrated,0
1987,I only wish that I can get my money back and I will never again  purchase a software program with a key card,1
1988,"I'm from the old school, I like to have the cd rom to install the programs",0
1989,"I have used office and its a decent office suite, I guess (I bought it because my Mom likes it",0
1990,What is really annoying me is that the servers to validate the purchase have been done for at least 24 hours at this point,-1
1991,When I called Mircrosoft support the confirmed this and said try tomorrow,0
1992,"Let's all say it together, DRM and Mircosoft Suck!",0
1993,Great deal and works as expected,1
1994,Glad I was able to find this key card for this price,0
1995,Fantastic worth every penny,1
1996,it's going to take me a bit to learn how to use it all but it's everything I expected and then some,0
1997,I don't think much needs to be said about the quality of Microsoft Office,1
1998,This card gives you access to Office on 5 PCs or Macs plus 5 iPads or Windows tablets so it's incredible value even at RRP,0
1999,I had no problem activating my subscription on Windows but the Mac version of Office refused to accept my username and password,0
2000,I eventually managed to talk to somebody at Microsoft (online chat was useless) and the problem was I had turned on two-factor authentication,0
2001,Turning this off solved the problem,0
2002,Hope that helps somebody else,0
2003,"For some reason, even though  I only authorized it on one machine so far, it has used two of the installations for one machine",0
2004,Simple and easy,1
2005,Buy the card,1
2006,Wait for delivery,0
2007,Enter card,0
2008,Receive 1 year subscription access and appreciate bug discount off of $100,0
2009,I entered the key on the last day of my subscription and renewed  without any trouble,0
2010,Not sure what happens if you enter a key early---does your subscription renew from the date you enter the key or from the date your subscription expires?,0
2011,Decided to finally replace Office 2003 with Office 365 and I am pleased with the results,0
2012,Installation was very easy and the newer version of Office uses much less hard drive space than the older 2003 version,1
2013,This was important since my installation was on a vintage PC upgraded to Windows 7,0
2014,"The online instructions did not specify whether or not the old Office version needed to be uninstalled prior to installing Office 365, but I decided to uninstall 2003 first due to hard drive space",0
2015,The new Outlook picked up all my old message files automatically,0
2016,After the install I found a FAQ on the Microsoft support site indicating that Office 365 is designed to operate along side of any older versions of Office so it would not have been necessary to uninstall Office 2003,0
2017,"However, I think it is cleaner and certainly more secure using only the newer 365 version",0
2018,"This is obviously an annual subscription service, but with multiple devices, this subscription covers all devices in our household making it a better deal",0
2019,Does what I need,0
2020,3 PC's one iPad,0
2021,Can use even if not on Internet programs install on each device,0
2022,Full office,0
2023,Annual fee way less even buying Office Home-Student every other release,0
2024,Great alternative to the pricey full software purchase,1
2025,Especially since the key can be shared with multiple users,0
2026,With 4 of us in the house - the full software suite purchase is cost prohibitive,0
2027,"Even though it's a yearly cost, it's far more manageable",2
2028,Full office functionality included at a fraction of the cost,0
2029,Very cool to have this amazing flexibility with my work,1
2030,"Always where I need it! Great price, easy to install and use",1
2031,"I'll defer the whole ""Office"" review to the multitudes of others and focus on the subscription licensing model, which is the core of the O365 vs Office retail difference",0
2032,With the regular retail package you pay once and apply the license to one device (and if you're like me have a lot of difficulty switching that license to another PC if you ever replace the original,0
2033,"With this version of O365 you pay PER YEAR, but always have the latest version, have online storage, and (key for me) INSTALLATION ON UP TO 5 DEVICES",0
2034,"There is also a ""Personal"" version of O365 for $65 that installs on 1 device - this to me is a waste; if you're only putting on 1 device you'll probably be better suited for the regular Office package",0
2035,At $73 I found the Office 365 Home Premium 1yr Subscription Key Card to be an excellent value because of our situation and the 5-PC allowance,0
2036,"I have my own laptop, and each of my 2 kids have 2 laptops - one that stays at my house and another that stays at at their mother's",0
2037,"In the past this meant buying 5 different licenses, and go through the pain of trying to swap activations from one pc to another if we replaced their computers every 3 years",0
2038,"It was possible, but also a pain to set them up and change their behavior to use online document storage so that they could access files whether there or here",0
2039,"(as a side note to offset those ""why don't you just have them carry their laptops back and forth?"" - one word ""breakage"")",0
2040,"Anyway, it's pretty easy to get set up so that our 5 PCs are all up to date with current versions with the software that they need for their schoolwork, and the online storage is seamless and well integrated so they can always access their files whether they are at their mother's house or mine",1
2041,The subscription model worked well for us,1
2042,"A Basic Office package per PC is $110 - if you are like our situation and have a houseful of devices that's $550, and then expect to pay that again when the newer version comes out or you replaced a PC and had problems getting the licenses migrated to another PC",0
2043,Add in the online cloud storage access ease and it definitely improves the cost/convenience model,0
2044,Works on PC/Mac and iPads,1
2045,I was recently doing extensive business traveling and moved one of my licenses from my laptop to my iPad temporarily while I was more mobile yet still wanted basic edit access to Office package,0
2046,When I was back and things settled down I was able to easily switch back again,0
2047,Which is of note - if you want to use the Office package for more than viewing and actually need to create/edit Office docs on your iPad you are going to need an O365 license,0
2048,If you are a single device user by all means I think the regular Office license is likely to be best for you,0
2049,"However, I think if you have multiple devices this makes for a great deal",0
2050,This isn't the complete office 365 so in some ways it is misleading,0
2051,The one that is almost $100 is the one you need to buy if you want the complete one,0
2052,Have only used office 365 $100 so can't compare to anything else,0
2053,"Exactly what was advertised, and arrived very quickly",1
2054,Good Buy,1
2055,Would recommend to others,1
2056,"Nice being able to use key for all my devices, instead of having to purchased product separately for each",0
2057,This was the best price for Office 365,1
2058,It is the key card and can be used to renew subscription,0
2059,Very easy to install and use,1
2060,"Applicable for multiple computers, with cloud storage available for files - has all of the Office functionality for a year, and at a reasonable price",0
2061,Very easy to install and manage the installations,1
2062,You can deactivate your installations at any time by logging into the site,0
2063,You can also install directly from the site once you are fully setup,0
2064,5 licenses make this very helpful to install on multiple devices,0
2065,If you want to save some cash this is a simple way instead of auto renewing through Microsoft,0
2066,To avoid any hassles enter key card code prior to expiration,0
2067,"If account does expire before you renew, you just have to make sure you resign in on all devices",0
2068,"Not a big deal, but a tad annoying",2
2069,"I am very satisfied with the product, it was exactly what I wanted",1
2070,Everything is great,1
2071,Would recommend it to anyone,1
2072,Product was exactly as described and I had no problem installing it on my new computer,1
2073,Very satisfied customer and will definitely renew when it expires,1
2074,Microsoft charges 99,0
2075,"99 for a one year subscription online and in stores, when I ordered this product from amazon I only paid about 60 dollars, so I ordered 2 cards saving myself about 80 dollars",0
2076,This product has everything you need for Office on 5 devices and up to 2 mobile devices,1
2077,"As someone who travels frequently, mobility is key",0
2078,The ability to work on my Surface or iPhone justified this purchase,0
2079,"Sure you can buy the regular home edition, but the limitation of installs becomes annoying if you own more than one computer",0
2080,"I've used Office 365 for almost a year and although it is not as stable as I would like it to be (I go through the control panel/programs to change/repair it occasionally), Office 365 performs well enough for the most part",0
2081,"My concern was that this key card might not extend my subscription because Microsoft recently changed the name of the ""Office 365 Home Premium"" to ""Office 365 Home"", but it did (so the 5 stars are for the key doing what I needed it to do rather than a review of Office 365, which I would give 4 stars)",0
2082,This product from Microsoft has turned our small office of 5 against Microsoft PCs and we are planning to purchase Macs to replace the lot,0
2083,We purchased this product for upgrading to Office 2013 as well as the added cloud support,0
2084,"As with all Microsoft products, with the 2013 outlook, excel, and word, all of the functions are rearranged so that you have to take a new course or spend hours finding the same functions that were mindless before",0
2085,And the worst part is the cloud accessibility and support,-1
2086,"The SkyDrive/Onedrive is way to slow when working with large files, and many times even smaller files couldn't be opened at all online, with an eternal ""processing file"" or ""sorry unable to open file"" message",0
2087,"After going round and round with Microsoft on the phone and by chat (I was redirected back and forth, left on hold, hung up on, and basically told by Microsoft that there is NO support for the SkyDrive/OneDrive), I was left high and dry",0
2088,Never again,-1
2089,as stated,0
2090,"As soon as the iPad Office 365 apps got released and I saw them in action, I knew I wanted to upgrade my Office to Office 365",0
2091,I was able to save quite a bit of money over buying the subscription through the App Store or directly through Microsoft by buying this subscription key card,0
2092,The apps run beautifully on my two windows pcs and my ipads,1
2093,"By keeping all of my documents in sync across devices by saving them on Microsoft OneDrive (20GB included for free), I have seen a great increase in my productivity",0
2094,"I was in the process of migrating all of my productivity work to Google Drive, but am very disappointed in the way that Google Drive runs on iOS",-1
2095,"I was hesitant to embrace the subscription model especially when Google gives it away for free, but now I am a full believer thinking it is well worth it to keep my software up-to-date and running well across all computers without having to worry about upgrading every few years",0
2096,or locking myself into Microsoft long-term if somebody else comes up with something better,0
2097,The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels,0
2098,And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this,0
2099,"Finally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices",0
2100,The value that this adds to the program is incredible,0
2101,I'm very happy with my purchase and very happy that I was able to save money here,1
2102,If you're not sure how long you'll need to use Office products this is the way to go since you can use it for several years and then renew only what or how much you need later vs spending a lot of money up front for product you may not need shortly,0
2103,My trial subscription ran out and searched for a better price,0
2104,"Was happy with this purchase, and had no problem with the product key",1
2105,I am not sure yet if the 1 yr subscription is better than buying the software,0
2106,"The ""Key Card"" product:
This is an excellent way to get a bargain subscription",0
2107,The Key Card was only $63,0
2108,"15 for a 12 month subscription, while the direct download was $99",0
2109,Want to save even more and get instant gratification?  Buy the Key Card on Amazon and it will be delivered in a few days,0
2110,"In the mean time, sign up for the 1 month free trial at Microsoft:
[",0
2112,"When the Key Card comes in the mail, log into your Office account and apply the product code from the Key Card",0
2113,It will extend your subscription 12 months past the free trial month expiration (instead of the current date),0
2114,"This gives you 13 months for the bargain Key Card price and immediate use of Office 365!

We have 5 computers and 2 smartphones in my house, so this subscription based version of Microsoft Office is much more affordable than upgrading 4 different computers every few years at several hundred dollars per machine",0
2115,"As for the Office 365 software itself, I don't have enough experience with it yet to truly give it a rating",0
2116,I will say installation was painless on Windows 7 and Windows 8,1
2117,OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is your personal syncing cloud that ties to Office 365 (you get an extra 20GB for free with Office 365),0
2118,"I've installed the app on an Android and Blackberry 10 phone, and it works quite well",1
2119,So far I'm quite pleased with the value and functionality of this product,1
2120,First you go to Walmart and get the university edition,0
2121,Next you find out only students can use the university edition and they basically need transcripts from a school,0
2122,"You think, oh, I will use my son to activate/download office but then I don't have three days for the school to verify my son's enrollment",0
2123,Then you call Microsoft and they have no idea what a product key card is and can't understand why I haven't downloaded the program yet,0
2124,"So you figure that you will download it and return the university edition later, checkout page crash-blank, crash, crash but at least there is a chat link on the page(not doing it)",0
2125,"To Walmart and exchange for office 365, expensive but I get 5 devices to use it so it seems like an OK deal",0
2126,I get home FINALLY get office on one computer and then I think I have beaten the Microsoft monster,1
2127,Then I get to my wife's computer to log in at office online and I am greeted with: This subscription has been cancelled,0
2128,Set up an auto-renew subscription,0
2129,Maybe I will contact support,-1
2130,Most likely I will return the card and try again,-1
2131,On the brighter side the office 365 download order page was loaded after I got home from Walmart with office 365,0
2132,"I would like to take this time to apologize to a couple of support people I ripped into, rather into Microsoft on the phone",2
2133,Microsoft should realize that the world doesn't revolve around them for people that do not work in an office(ex,0
2134,send all files in word 97-2003)and they cannot keep customers loyal with this experience,0
2135,"This begs the question why has no one tried to take on the Microsoft behemoth with a competing, and dare I say(I said it), office suite",0
2136,So needless to say I had to pass on my work to another person and my manager wasn't pleased,0
2137,I especially likes the enter product key-login-enter product key again bit,0
2138,Priceless,1
2139,They have the fools lining up,0
2140,"For clarification and to save someone the headache:  Program eligibility requirements

This Program is available only to individuals who meet the criteria described below (the ""Eligible Students""):
Individual must be either a full- and part-time enrolled student, or a faculty / staff member of a qualified, accredited higher education institution",0
2141,Alumni of these institutions aren't eligible,-1
2142,"Qualified, accredited higher education institutions include Universities, Polytechnic schools, and Institutes of Technology, as well as other post-secondary level institutions, such as colleges and vocational schools that award academic degrees or professional certifications",0
2143,Restrictions may vary by country,0
2144,"Individual must successfully verify their eligibility status through the Offer Site's online academic verification process; and
Individual must have a Microsoft account or create one at the time of purchase",0
2145,"If you participate in the Program, Microsoft reserves the right to contact you directly or through an appointed Microsoft vendor to verify that you are an Eligible Student",0
2146,"If you choose not to provide sufficient documentation to Microsoft or its appointed vendor that verifies that you are an Eligible Student, you agree to reimburse Microsoft for the difference between what you paid in connection with a discounted Program offer and the estimated full retail price of the same product(s)",0
2147,Microsoft will have sole discretion to determine the sufficiency of any documentation that you provide to verify you are an Eligible Student,0
2148,"By providing eligibility-related information to Microsoft's appointed vendor, you agree that the vendor may share such information with Microsoft for Program-related purposes",0
2149,"Microsoft, in its sole discretion, may accept other forms of validation to determine eligibility in lieu of the online academic verification process",0
2150,"Microsoft, in its sole discretion, may determine the criteria for eligibility under the Program and may change the eligibility criteria or deny eligibility at any time and for any reason",0
2151,"Loving this! Installed on both of my Macs and on my iPad and iPhone, added to the fact that I have Office no my Windows notebook at work! I'm working on a very complex user guide, and I now have access to it no matter where I happen to be! I can break it up into pieces of work on the entire document at will! I'm instantly more productive! It's all tied together with One Note and OneDrive! All of my Office Docs are accessible on all of my devices! I REALLY like being able to dictate word documents on iOS! To top it all off, Amazon knocked it out of the park by finding THIS price!",0
2152,"The key card is an okay way to purchase Office 365 that I would gladly recommend to anyone needing the current suite of Office programs (Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint,etc",1
2153,"The only drawback to purchasing it online is that it comes by snail mail, but the reasonable price (about $65) easily overcame that drawback",-1
2154,I have used Office for many years and look forward to some of the new features in 365,1
2155,Idea that this includes installation on 5 devices including computers along with tablets and phones is very interesting,0
2156,One issue - when in initially installed the Key and used Excel a warning popped up indicating this was an unregistered copy and needed activation,-1
2157,Evidently a known issue,0
2158,"After some searching the internet I found that you need to open one of the modules by clicking ""Run as Administrator""",0
2159,This registers the module and eliminates the Needs Activation warning,0
2160,Would have been helpful to include details of installation issues with the key card,0
2161,Office 365 HP gives you access to all of the Microsoft Office products that you need,0
2162,However this comes as a yearly subscription vs the traditional software purchase,0
2163,"As such, the price is MUCH lower up front",0
2164,It works on up to 5 PCs / Macs and also comes with licenses for the Android and iPhone / iPad Office apps,0
2165,I got this back when I bought a new laptop as it was offered as a deal,0
2166,I did not renew the subscription through Microsoft as they wanted $99 to renew,0
2167,So I just purchased a new key from Amazon for around $65 which was much cheaper for another year,0
2168,Just entered the new key once it expired,0
2169,Everything works again,1
2170,"I like this because you can use it/ install it on both PC's and MAC's along with iPads, etc",1
2171,You know you'll be getting the latest and greatest apps,0
2172,I wish they would add Visio to this package,0
2173,"You've gotta have Office, this is a great way to do our and a great price, especially for me with 5 computers!",0
2174,I have used Office 365 Home Premium for a little over a year now,0
2175,The opportunity to purchase these 1 yr subscription cards just extends my current subscription for an additional year,0
2176,I'm set now through 2017 with all the upgrades available yet to come,0
2177,In addition this is included on up to 5 PC's so doing the math it's the least expensive Microsoft Office products I've ever purchased and no worries about using older generations,0
2178,I Bought This So I Could Get Full Use Of The Office iPad Apps,0
2179,"However I Also Did 2 Mac Installs, & 2 Windows Installs !! Was Completely Painless, & The KEY Code WAS Valid !!!",0
2180,My subscription end date for this product is the middle of December 2014,0
2181,However Microsoft in its infinite wisdom has determined the subscription expires in March of 2014,0
2182,"I've used both hands and one foot to count out 12 months, and seeing I purchased this from Amazon in December 2013",0
2183,I'm not sure how Microsoft comes up with an expiration of March 2014,0
2184,I have been on the phone over a month trying to clear this up with Microsoft,1
2185,I probably could have bought Office just from the amount on my cell phone costs,0
2186,"I have been put on hold transferred from one department to another, mysteriously disconnected, and spoke with managers who have no power to do anything, only to end up at the original department I started with, and ride the Merry-Go-Round again",0
2187,"Everyone agrees on the REAL expiration date, no one will take ownership to really resolve the problem",0
2188,"I asked for a one month extension on my subscription for the aggravation, time, and cost that I have gone through",0
2189,Of course Microsoft states they can't do that because I bought it from Amazon,0
2190,I asked Microsoft if I purchased Amazon Office or Microsoft Office,0
2191,One manager came up with the bright idea to sign up for a free 30 day trial and that would be the month????  Amazon can you help me with this problem?  I probably will be cut off again by Microsoft and my Office 365 will disappear from my computer again,0
2192,"Just a warning to everyone else, If your Office 365 is mysteriously missing from your computer one day start right with Microsoft",0
2193,They take away the bonus 20 gig on One drive also,0
2194,Oh well that's a story for a different day,0
2195,Amazon any help would be appreciated,1
2196,The only real question is - does this card work? It's the lowest priced way to buy Office 365 so that's a reasonable question,0
2197,It's a 100% legit Microsoft issued card,0
2198,Punch in the code and they take it just like any other card,0
2199,A few minutes later you have office on 5 computers and 5 tablets,0
2200,"You and your buddies have 100 gig of One Drive to play with, and you can make random Skype calls all over the world for 60 minutes a month",0
2201,"What happens in a year? Well hopefully you can buy another card, dump in into your account and save some more money",0
2202,That of course assumes that the giant asteroid misses us and we're all still here,0
2203,"Runs great with my laptop, much better option then purchasing the old fashioned way",0
2204,"Has everything I need and more, I will be ready to renew next year! Love it!",0
2205,Ok I was paying $9,0
2206,99/month on Office,0
2208,Read about this subscription card,0
2209,Thought it was too good to be true,0
2210,Bought it,1
2211,Got it two days later,0
2212,Put in the code and I'm set for a year,0
2213,Now paying $67/yr instead of $120 direct through office,0
2214,com subscription,0
2215,Easiest $53 I've saved all year,0
2216,Highly recommend this if you are paying full rack rate on Office,1
2218,I love the program - big improvement,1
2219,It does all it says and is easy to install,1
2220,Having it for five computers makes it a great deal,0
2221,I opted for a subscription to enable Office editing on my iPad and install Office on my home PC,0
2222,"Considering that this enables you to install Office on up to 5 PCs and Macs, and 5 iPads or Windows tablets, plus offers 20GB of storage for up to 5 users and 60 Skype minutes per month, it could easily be worth $67 for a year",0
2223,If you already have Office and just need it to activate edit capabilities on an iPad it's a little less clear since there are cheaper options (including Apple iWork) for casual use,0
2224,"If you regularly work with Office documents and need the assurance of file compatibility, this looks like a good option",1
2225,So far I've tried Word and PowerPoint,0
2226,There are some quirks on the iPad,0
2227,"For instance, it took me a little while to figure out how to activate an Office 365 subscription purchased elsewhere from within the iPad apps themselves",0
2228,"And, the lack of AirPrint capabilities on the iPad is a bit perplexing, and hopefully is addressed soon",0
2229,But the apps themselves are easy to use and surprisingly powerful,0
2230,"Both have handled attachments flawlessly, and are the best I've seen at preserving formatting",0
2231,"just getting started, so far I am satisfied",0
2232,Will be able to update later to see about recommending it to others,0
2233,Will this version work on ipad? Will it work on 5 iPads? I don't see any comments related to iPads specifically,0
2234,Thanks,1
2235,Not a U,0
2236,version This would not activate in the U,0
2237,"Gave the error ""This product key isn't meant for your region",0
2238,"For help with this error, contact support",0
2239,""" The box reads ""MIDDLE WAST DM MEDIALESS"" and ""ORIGIN:IRELAND""",0
2240,They bury the ability to download five licenses so far I can't find it and have been searching for an hour,0
2241,Crazy,0
2242,I bought this so I could have outlook on all my devises and make running  my business more efficient,0
2243,"Even though I made an Imap mail box, the program ate my emails and deleted them off my original server,  making them totally unfindable",0
2244,"I know they are in a folder some where but that folder is not visible to me  nor is any old mail, mailbox available",0
2245,I spent hours researching on line and then another  8 hours with two different tech guys  and  was not able to fix it,-1

2256,No wonder the CEO resigned,0
2257,Poor Microsoft,0
2258,Sinking ship,0
2259,good over all,0
2260,I hope the updates every year are worth it,0
2261,It has everything that you need to get things done,0
2262,Excellent as I use most aspects - can use on multiple machines and easy to use and install - quite a bit lest costly than buying from Microsoft,0
2263,Great price for a brand new product that works as advertised,0
2264,"Someone screwed up and damaged the retail packaging it came in so I got it for almost half price as ""open box""",0
2265,Computers don't come with Office any longer,0
2266,I tried Open Office for a few months and the fact that it is free was a nice bonus,1
2267,But it really didn't work that well and it was changing the format my documents were in,-1
2268,"When I saw that Amazon had a sale of Microsoft Office, I decided to purchase it and go back to what I understood and had used before",1
2269,It downloaded very easily and I've been using it very successfully,1
2270,"I'm also going to put it on my laptop, that is as soon as I find the charging cord which I put is a safe place",1
2271,"Somehow I never find my safe places again--oh well, maybe Amazon has an extra cord I'll have to order",0
2272,"This product may have a yearly subscription, but getting the updates as they come out and having access to all Microsoft's Office product is well worth the annual fee",0
2273,Office 365 is less than $100 per year for 5 users,0
2274,We purchased this and our kids use it on their Macs while my wife and I use it on our PC's,0
2275,What did we do with the 5th license?  Donated it to a friend who is a single mom and widow,0
2276,It's really nice to have that flexibility,1
2277,"The key card is good for up to five devices, downloads effortlessly, and gives the user a very broad range of programs that might be unaffordable if individually purchased",0
2278,The cost alone is enticing,0
2279,As updates to software have become more and more frequent it makes more sense to subscribe than to buy expensive cd's good for use on only one computer,0
2280,"So far, everything has worked very well",1
2281,"While I have not used every program yet, because there are so many, I am raving over the word program",-1
2282,"The only downside in word is that the program does not seem to have the customary two page view that is so important to me, unless there is a way to get it that I have not discovered",0
2283,"Otherwise, the program is fast and intuitive",0
2284,If you have numerous devices this is the way to go if you want to get the same programs for less money,0
2285,I believe you have to at least be updated to Windows 7,0
2286,Love it and will purchases more items in future with this person,1
2287,"really great customer service and gets to you in timely fashion, which i love",1
2288,All in all really awesome,1
2289,glad i got the Office 365,1
2290,I wih I had been a bit more informed as to the usability of this product,1
2291,I purchased this product in hopes of avoiding a larger monitary expendature,1
2292,"However, the usability of this product requires you to be connected to the SkyDrive",1
2293,"Excel, Word etc",0
2294,can not be saved to my desktop if I'm not connected,0
2295,This actually doesn't work for me because I work in remote parts of the world were internet access is sketchy at best,0
2296,I ended up spending the cash for the one computer suite and am waiting on delivery,0
2297,I used the one month trial of Office 2013 and think it's outstanding,1
2298,"I believe that a combination of the 365 and Office 2013 maybe a great match set, though I won't know until I'm back in the States",2
2299,"Over Priced!  Unbelievable, they know you like it so they stick it to you",-1
2300,"Anyways, I was raised on Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc",0
2301,and enjoy having them as tools in my arsenal but the cost is ridiculous,0
2302,If I wasn't so spoiled I would think twice,0
2303,It was confusing to use and didn't recognize previous applications-Word spreadsheets and Word documents,0
2304,It took a lot of time to resave documents in different formats so they could be opened up and used,0
2305,It is confusing to find the same commands that were easily found in XL and Windows 7 Word formats,0
2306,"I have gotten use to it, but still am looking on how to do some of the common commands",0
2307,"I have been a Microsoft user since the days of MSDOS and green screens, and this is the worst software I have ever bought from them",0
2308,THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION for the product,0
2309,"in the box or online!!! No help button, no good description of set-up, no information on how to prep for the install (e",0
2310,"Do I remove my old version of Office 2007 first?), no idea of how to use it!!!
After two days of snooping, I finally found a link to ""import your e-mail accounts and settings"" but it returned a ""no mail clients found on this PC"" message and guess what",0
2311,no help buttons anywhere,0
2312,"This is not a simple upgrade (of which I've successfully done hundreds), it is a major change in the way you open programs and use them",0
2313,shame on Microsoft for not providing a clear path,0
2314,I will try to return this and buy Office 2013,-1
2315,or just throw it in the trash,-1
2316,apparently I can't even write a letter unless I'm online!,-1
2317,"I've always been a MS Office advocate, but I'm NOT happen w/this new way of using MS Office Apps",-1
2318,"I started my subscription w/MS almost 2 months ago, I have not found a solution to get my MS Outlook App working",0
2319,"why I don't know, all the other Office apps work fine, but I really NEED my Outlook app to work",0
2320,and it doesn't,0
2321,"I purchased this as an upgrade to my expiring 365 product, and it was a VERY easy upgrade",1
2322,Also a great price,1
2323,lower than any  offers I could find during the winter holidays,0
2324,I've read mixed reviews about 365,2
2325,"Personally, I love it",1
2326,"Skydrive (name soon to change) loads nicely into Windows 7, on my Nook tablet, and Motorola Droid phones, and has worked seamlessly over the past year and a half",0
2327,The office software also updates regularly and seamlessly,0
2328,"It may be slowing down my initial startup a bit (I also have a subscription to Adobe products which load at startup), but the convenience is well worth it to me",0
2329,don't like basic package with one year termination,0
2330,Gave it to a family member who will have multiple uses right away,0
2331,I need it for work but also use it for various reasons,1
2332,Nice to be able to give my family the option to use it too having a subscription for 4 others,1
2333,I thought the change would be very difficult,0
2334,"Let's face it - my comfort level was challenged, but It is great easy and I can easily access my work from anywhere",0
2335,I really like it,1
2336,Lletting go was not as hard as I had thought,0
2337,I have enjoyed working with the Office 365 product,1
2338,I just don't like the rental program,0
2339,That is you have to renew every year,0
2340,Great product,1
2341,We have enjoyed it,1
2342,The key card worked well,1
2343,So far we have installed on 2 computers,0
2344,"As someone noted, it tries to default to skydrive which is a pain but you can change it",0
2345,Personally I like hard copies so I am not thrilled with being forced to buy a key card as opposed to a disk,1
2346,I would not have tried this if my first year hadn't come free with my Windows 8 computer,0
2347,"However having used it and added it to my other computers that had much older versions of Office, I am becoming convinced (at least for now) that this is a reasonable way to update office when you have multiple devices",0
2348,If however the subscription price does start rising over time I am not likely to continue with it,-1
2349,"I'm a little suspicious, but happy with it for now",0
2350,I too have been using Micro Soft products for ever and was anticipating to see what their new offering would be like,0
2351,Word and Excel look just like what I was familiar with and the fact that I can access things from anywhere is fantastic,0
2352,It integrated well with SkyDrive to gives all of the access you would or could want,0
2353,"Microsoft excels at producing products that no one wants, and destroying good products (e",0
2354,Win 7) and replacing them with junk (Win 8),0
2355,"Surprisingly, this is the product that proves that they are capable of better",0
2356,"Includes all the Office apps anyone could want, you can use them on 5 machines, and the yearly (rental) cost is reasonable",0
2357,This key is $20 less than the online digital upgrade,0
2358,Came in 2 days with Prime,0
2359,Was easily able to renew my subscription by entering the code on the office live web site under my account,1
2360,"I ordered the ""subscription/download"" package to take advantage of all the Microsoft programs for a reduced cost",1
2361,"The key card arrived as scheduled and I have no complaints with the seller, who delivered as promised",0

2375,This is simply the best version of Office yet,1
2376,The 365 subscription gives you access on 5 devices PLUS mobile,1
2377,Its great to have,1
2378,I can look through documents and spreadsheets anywhere,1
2379,Combined with skydrive this app is unbelievable,1
2380,Just plain outstanding,1
2381,It has changed the way I work on my IPhone,1
2382,Only wish it also came with Visio!,1
2383,Save a little money here over buying directly from Microsoft,0
2384,Office 365 is the best way to buy Office if you have two or more PCs and any smart phones or tablets,1
2385,"The new Outlook is industrial strength for calendar, mail and contacts and has a good task manager",1
2386,"All the other apps, Word, Excel, Publisher, etc",0
2387,are best of breed and with the rent-to-use model of Office 365 you will always have the latest versions,1
2388,I'm running it on Windows 8,0
2389,"1 and find no bugs, (so far)",0
2390,The 20 GB of SkyDrive Storage has good value too and I love the way I can access my important docs and photos from my phone via SkyDrive,0
2391,"Overall, good value for the money",1
2392,Put outlook in as my email for my Gmail account and it downloaded 8000 plus messages from that account,0
2393,It's defaulted to use One note as the printer wasted a lot of time figuring out how to change,0
2394,We bought two new PC's for our high school aged kids this Christmas (2013),0
2395,"Obviously, they were each going to need a copy of Office for their schoolwork",0
2396,We wanted to upgrade our home laptop too,0
2397,Since this allows you to install on up to five PC's the pricing worked out better for us in the short term,0
2398,We didn't have to shell out $600 for three copies of Office 2013,0
2399,"Gone, are the days of owning and installing a copy of Office on your laptop",0
2400,"Typically, you'd replace a PC every five years, or so, anyway",0
2401,"Most people would always install a new copy of Office on a new laptop, so you'd be purchasing a new copy for each machine at $200 every few years",0
2402,This ends up costing about the same or less if you are installing on multiple machines,0
2403,"For installation on one machine, you might be still be better off to purchase a copy",0
2404,Installation was easy,1
2405,We installed it on the old laptop as well as the two new ones with no problems,1
2406,"Again, the biggest advantage is that (for $99/year) you can install on up to five machines",0
2407,"If you get rid of a PC, you can simply go to your Microsoft account and deactivate that copy",0
2408,That frees up a copy that you can download to a new PC,0
2409,Another advantage is that it remains updated too,1
2410,"No more wondering if you want to spend the money to upgrade to the latest version - you'll already have it!

This version also comes with all of the Office products too",0
2411,"We don't use them all, but they're available if we ever need them",0
2412,A friend of mine in the industry (also used to work for MS) tells me that this is simply the way it will be done in the future anyway,0
2413,"You can resist for now, but eventually, we'll all be ""renting"" Office from MS",0
2414,"This office edition was what i needed, i needed for all of my pc and this suffice all that i needed and the shipment was great",0
2415,thanks,1
2416,Don't upgrade to 2013,-1
2417,The products do not work better than the 2010 or even 2007 versions,-1
2418,Outlook 2013 is a mess,2
2419,Once the product installs it works great but the install is filled with difficult install problems,0
2420,It makes you uninstall any other office products that are already on the computer and they don't uninstall without a lot of issues,2
2421,If the product installed easier it would be an awesome product,1
2422,I really thought this was one of those programs I could get a lot of use out of,1
2423,However I have used this program so very little that I cannot give a meaningful review to it,0
2424,From what I've seen of it and had I really got into using itI can say that it's a top shelf program,0
2425,need to have flexibility for all family members around the US,0
2426,this type of product really does the trick for us!,1
2427,"I am still getting used to MS 365 so I cannot give it a full rating, however I do like it so far and got it for a great holiday price!  Definitely a better price than any store offerings",0
2428,Cloud server support is interesting - but - if you are on a DSL land-line - meh! - every cloud server is an island,0
2429,New menu system is acceptable - simpler than last time - but still over-complicated and intimidating to casual users,0
2430,I am glad Microsoft did something to include publisher with their office products,1
2431,I really like the new functionality of the software,1
2432,The only draw back is that it is subscription based on a yearly rotation,-1
2433,There needs to be something like the four year one for teachers that do NOT have an,-1
2434,edu email,0
2436,Complete and easy install,1
2437,Not crazy about the subscription based service,0
2438,"I went back and forth as to whether I should just do a one-time purchase of the suite, or go with the yearly subscription",0
2439,The download from the MS Office site was quick and easy,1
2440,"The programs in the Office suite do all the same things, but the opening screen (when you start the program) have changed a bit, as well as the views when you attempt to save a file",0
2441,"More integration for ""SkyDrive""",0
2442,"All things considered, it does what you expect",0
2443,The subscription model and some of the changes make it less appealing and user friendly in some very small ways,0
2444,false claims,0
2445,states you can load on2 3 PCs but you can only use the key ONCE,0
2446,gonna stick to my other program until Microsoft fixes this issue,0
2447,I love the name: Office-365!  So appropriate -- you pay for it 365 days per year every year,0
2448,It's the product that just keeps taking while you keep paying,0
2449,Take a look at SoftMaker Office suite instead,0
2450,It's very compatible and well supported,1
2451,They have a free version called SoftMaker FreeOffice that you can try,0
2452,You'll be glad you did,1
2453,after entering key took two weeks of phone calls (average 2 hrs/day) to Microsoft tech support to finally get the subscription activated,0
2454,Downloading this product is no different than downloading various utility software products you've come to rely upon,0
2455,"For all the aspersions folks cast upon Microsoft, what other company so regularly updates its products to provide new features, quality service, and network safety to its consumers",0
2456,Few of the majors do as much,0
2457,"With two laptops at home, plus a desktop, keeping Word and Outlook current was an expensive prospect",-1
2458,"However, at $99 for five downloads, this is a bargain",0
2459,"Yeah, you need to ""renew"" every year for $99 to keep your cloud subscription current, but it's still far cheaper than buying the software individually for multiple computers",0
2460,"The download was easy, although the amount of data means it takes a while regardless of how fast your computer is",1
2461,"You can use your computer while it downloads, though, so not a drawback",0
2462,"Outlook is basically the same as previous versions, so everything is good there",0
2463,"Word is slightly different, and I've run into reverse compatibility issues when sending",0
2464,docx files from this version to people who have older versions of Word,0
2465,"Mostly it has to do with the comment boxes and Track Changes, which may not be an issue for everyone",0
2466,"Overall, the price and ease of installation makes this the obvious choice, even if all you need are Word, Outlook and Excel",0
2467,No problems with installation using this key card,0
2468,Love the discount over regular download,1
2469,"I plan on weighing options for different product in a year, so I don't mind the yearly subscription avaiable for 5 computers",0
2470,"fast delivery, easy to load, only took 30 seconds to get my subscription up and running",0
2471,lots of people don't like the new fee system but with every software company moving that way this is really a good deal,0
2472,"just recently owned 2010 and this one is much better as its more versatile using it on tablets, phones, and even at work",0
2473,Excellent value for this state of the art product,1
2474,Subscription software just makes economic sense,0
2475,"I love Word, Excel and Outlook and all of the other products: cloud space and Skype free calls are bonuses!",1
2476,"The application is great, always has been",1
2477,"BUT now that Apple/Google offer free app's that can do more/most of what is normally used in this package and their output is compatible with any other computer, this is more suited to the big corporate users who may need crazy capabilities",0
2478,The average user will never begin to tap into the capabilities of this program and IMHO it would be wasting money for most anyone to buy an annual contract,0
2479,"I'm an IT/Telecom geek for near 40 years and I would recommend you go for the freebies (Apple/Google - depending on your computer) or even buy a MS stand alone app, the annual subscription is just insurance for MS to forecast and guarantee future profits",0
2480,Not worth the money,-1
2481,"Although Office 365 is a good product, I hope the premium fee can be lowered a little",0
2482,That helps a lot for home users,0
2483,It is helpful software & wonderful needed for work propose to work at home since we are using Microsoft office,1
2484,i love how this works and i use it for school and i just love it,1
2485,it works great and i love the new options,1
2486,I had to return this item - when I tried to enter the Key code Windows told me that it was invalid,-1
2487,"Since I like to do my writing in various places using an iPad, a Mac, or a PC, I figured this cloud-based service would be helpful",0
2488,It didn't pan out for a few reasons,0
2489,"(1) The sign-in seems like more trouble than necessary, but I could have gotten used to it",0
2490,(2)  I had to download a cumbersome program in order for the service to interact with Office on my PC and Mac,0
2491,"(3) Worst of all, the Office 365 word processor doesn't work with iPad, which makes it unusable for me",-1
2492,"Big surprise, this Microsoft product is Windows-centric",0
2493,In the end I bought Pages,0
2494,"It's the best iPad word processor I've used, and all my documents show up on iCloud",1
2495,From there I can download them as Word documents or copy and paste whatever I need into a blank Word document,0
2496,"For someone who works entirely with Windows and needs to access files in different locations or while traveling, the Office 365 subscription could be a useful tool",0
2497,And it might be good for people working on group projects,0
2498,"I didn't test Excel or Power Point, so I can't judge how well they work on Office 365",0
2499,It's a decent service,1
2500,It's just not for me,0
2501,I guess it all depends on your needs,0
2502,"The software is great, but this is essentially a rental program",1
2503,"You buy again next year for $100 (if you have need for software for 5 machines and you need the cloud, then it is pretty reasonable at $20 per machine",0
2504,") I guess we are all looking for cost effective solutions, so this may work better for some than for others",0
2505,"Personally, I have resisted Adobe's efforts to put me into the rental group, I feel the same about this",0
2506,"But times they are a changing and sooner or later, we are all going to end up in a rental program",0
2507,but all i got was a key code and an internet download which was a hassel to finally complete,0
2508,i don't like the interface,-1
2509,looks bogus,-1
2510,i don't like it,-1
2511,it lacks aesthetics of a real ms office,-1
2512,don't waste your money,-1
2513,and it's only good for a year,-1
2514,i am going to buy the real cd as soon as this 1 yr is over,0
2515,"The current trend for software companies is to provide ""software as a service"" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time",0
2516,"There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it",0
2517,"This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e",2
2518,Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish),0
2519,"However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run",0
2520,"Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year",0
2521,"So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model",0
2522,"Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months",0
2523,Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere,0
2524,Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install,1
2525,You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes,0
2526,"In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design",0
2527,"I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations",0
2528,"Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options",0
2529,"Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions",0
2530,"I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet)",0
2531,This software requires internet access to download so be sure you have a decent connection before starting,0
2532,"Since I only have slow dsl available where I live, I chose to download at night",0
2533,"It still took me about 15 minutes to setup the Microsoft account, begin the product key setup, and then an additional 45 minutes for the software to install",-1
2534,This package includes the website to login or setup a Microsoft account and the product key for access,0
2535,This information is only a tiny pamphlet and a credit card size paper with the product key,0
2536,"I guess you could say it is ""green"" but I personally miss having a physical disc to install from",0
2537,You will need to remember this is a subscription so after a year you'll need to purchase it again to continue use,0
2538,I do like that it is available for up to 5 devices since most households have a mix of computers and tablets,0
2539,Oh and be sure to use all caps on your product key,1
2540,I had typed a few in lowercase and had to start over,0
2541,Also make sure you have windows 7 or newer to install this,0
2542,"Overall, this includes some nice features and works well if you need the current version on several devices",1
2543,Personally I like having a physical disc and not a subscription that expires so would definitely be considering alternatives in the future because of that,0
2544,Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers,0
2545,"But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model",0
2546,"But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product",0
2547,"And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department",0
2548,"Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable",-1
2549,"And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong",0
2550,"As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer",0
2551,"Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to",0
2552,"But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support",0
2553,So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business,0
2554,"Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced",1
2555,You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices,0
2556,"Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key",0
2557,"And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note",0
2558,"What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office)",0
2559,"And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever",0
2560,I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers,-1
2561,Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices,0
2562,"Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person",0
2563,"Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product",-1
2564,I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007,-1
2565,And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor,0
2566,But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365,-1
2567,"And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet",0
2568,"In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer",0
2569,"I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly",-1
2570,I write about a quarter million words a year in Word and I've become quite used to the program's idiosyncrasies,2
2571,I use the Mac version but we also have a PC at home that has Windows 7 loaded,0
2572,This is where the beauty of the subscription based system works,0
2573,You are allowed to load Office on up to 5 PC plus you can login to the Office website and use it from practically any PC,1
2574,The scuscription is a good deal because it's about $100 a year,1
2575,Paying by the month makes it $120 ($10 a month) so it is a cost saver,0
2576,Microsoft Office is pretty much the gold standard when it comes to productivity-type software,1
2577,"There's not much really to say about Office 365 if you've used previous versions of the software; it's clean, well designed, and intuitive",1
2578,"It may be a bit of a shock for those upgrading from earlier versions of Office (2003), as the layout has changed over the years, but once you get used to it, it's incredibly easy to use",-1
2579,"If you don't always need the latest and greatest features, having to buy a yearly subscription, rather than just a standalone product, is frustrating",0
2580,But you can still buy Office 2013 standalone; the benefit of the subscription is you always have an updated version of Microsoft Office,0
2581,"So there are two things I hate about this product:

1",-1
2582,That it is subscription based,0
2583,I think that having to pay to use it year after year is something that is going to tick off a lot of Microsoft's customers,0
2584,Especially the segment that would buy a version of the software and use it for a few years,0
2585,There are free products that will perform the same functions and save in the,0
2586,doc format,0
2588,Word makes me want to smack it every time I launch it,0
2589,I like it to open to to a new blank document upon launch,1
2590,I don't want to spend an extra 8 seconds choosing to launch a blank document,0
2591,Is this churlish of me? Yes,0
2592,"I admit that I have recently taken to using Scrivener, and so all other platforms seem clunky and scowl worthy by comparison",0
2593,"Sorry, Word 2013",-1
2594,"You will, for the most part, go unused",0
2595,"I'm not sure I'm crazy about the subscription idea, but I do like that I could install this on two PC's and a laptop for one price, and since you can put it on up to 5 devices for one $99 fee, I still have the option of loading it onto a tablet or something else if the need arises",0
2596,I wasn't crazy about having to download it onto each of my computers,0
2597,It takes forever to download,-1
2598,"I get my Internet through my TV cable, but it's not all that fast",-1
2599,It would have been nice to be able to order it on disc and save the download time,0
2600,"Fortunately, my ISP doesn't charge by the gigabyte or impose a data limit",0
2601,"I probably should have just downloaded Word, as that's all I ever use, but the whole Office 365 program isn't much more expensive than Word alone",0
2602,I just hope the annual subscription doesn't go up before it's time to renew,0
2603,I like being able to save my work to Skydrive so I can access it on whichever PC or laptop I choose,0
2604,First let me say the updates that have occured in Office over the past few updates have been GREAT!  If you are thinking about updating your version of office this is a great thing to consider,0
2605,"However, many software companies are doing this ""rent"" the software idea",0
2606,I like that the Office 2007 I own is mine and I can use it for as long as I have a computer that runs it,1
2607,One thing I really like about this Office version is that it contains Outlook at a somewhat reasonable price point,1
2608,I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me),1
2609,"The whole ""cloud"" thing is concern",-1
2610,"There may be files that I will be willing to put there however while it may be more secure (from hackers) than my home computer the court decisions on data I've ""shared"" with other vendors may not have as strong of legal protection as my home hard disk",0
2611,"(NPR did an interesting story on this)

All that being said I love the idea of being able to access document that I've been working on at home from other locations",0
2612,It is too hard to use,-1
2613,"Nothing like all the old ones, won't let me print, no toolbars that are decipherable",0
2614,I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I'll lose all of my files and projects that I've spent a long time working on,0
2615,One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations,1
2616,I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document,0
2617,"The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed",0
2618,"You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability",0
2619,) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens,0
2620,An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps,1
2621,"Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features",-1
2622,"However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app)",0
2623,I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device,-1
2624,"It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do",0
2625,Installation is fairly easy,1
2626,"You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address)",0
2627,"It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days",0
2628,After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software,0
2629,"The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription",0
2630,"Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version)",0
2631,They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage,0
2632,"It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around",0
2633,"I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually",0
2634,"If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365",1
2635,It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected,1
2636,I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am,1
2637,"I did not realize that this software does not work with anything older than Windows 7, so having 5 installations is of limited utility to me",0
2638,"I upgraded from Office 2003, so I am going through a learning curve",0
2639,"I'm sure there are shortcuts, but so far I am forced to use many more mouse clicks to accomplish the same task vs Office 2003",0
2640,It would be nice if the product improvements were equally obvious,1
2641,"Does what it is supposed to do, just not in all the ways I expected",0
2642,"For most of us, Microsoft Office is the de-facto standard of office suites, with Word being the predominant program",0
2643,"It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well",-1
2644,"In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s",0
2645,"There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>",0
2646,"This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs)",0
2647,"It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote",1
2648,"Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more",0
2649,"Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well",0
2650,"The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out",0
2651,"Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details",0
2652,"Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook",1
2653,"com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow",1
2654,Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card,0
2655,"Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account",0
2656,Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that,0
2657,"Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes",0
2658,"Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement",0
2659,"Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother",1
2660,The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed,-1
2661,"When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away",0
2662,What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite,0
2663,"I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use",0
2664,"SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time",0
2665,"This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections",0
2666,"Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time",0
2667,And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in,0
2668,"Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations",0
2669,"Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files",0
2670,"Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat",0
2671,"This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version",0
2672,"Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help",0
2673,"Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application",0
2674,"If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style",0
2675,"Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now",0
2676,"That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time",0
2677,"Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally",0
2678,"But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary",0
2679,"You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples",0
2680,"Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze",0
2681,Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it,0
2682,It's well worth it,1
2683,"OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites",1
2684,"First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited",0
2685,The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note,0
2686,"When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well",0
2687,"Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files",0
2688,"PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint",0
2689,"You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one",0
2690,"New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother",0
2691,"I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process",0
2692,"The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler",0
2693,"Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version",0
2694,"Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague",0
2695,"I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform",1
2696,I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible,0
2697,"Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point",-1
2698,"Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document",0
2699,"Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago",0
2700,"Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun",0
2701,"Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it",0
2702,"As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily",0
2703,It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web,0
2704,"There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon",0
2705,"Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK",0
2706,"When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized",0
2707,You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them,0
2708,"Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade",0
2709,"My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version",0
2710,My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine,1
2711,"I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC",0
2712,"Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review",0
2713,Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments,0
2714,"Summary:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review",0
2715,"Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions",0
2716,Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform,0
2718,Just to let everybody know who reads this review I am not an office expert I have office because I need it a few times a year,0
2719,So what I'm going to base my review on Is the ease and convenience of office 365 compared to the way the box software works,0
2720,it is so much more affordable if you have more than 1 computer or device,1
2721,So I'll start from the very beginning with my experience with office 365,0
2722,You get a rather small box in the mail and when you open it up there's a business sized card in the box,0
2723,I suggest you immediately take a picture of the key with your cell phone that way if you lose the box or damage the key you still retain the product key,1
2724,"You navigate to the website on the card
Put your product key and verifies it immediately then you log into your Microsoft account if you have one if you don't at this time you can easily and quickly make one",0
2725,And then you can download office and you're up and ready to go it's literally that quick,0
2726,What's great about office 365 is you can use it on up to five computers which is really cool,1
2727,and with being able to save your work on the cloud it's accessible to all of the computers that you have this office  on,0
2728,The downloading of office if I remember correctly was about a gig in size so if you're bandwidth limited this could take a little time,0
2729,Another neat thing is within that five computers they could be Mac or PC --I'm in a all mac household and everything worked without a hitch,0
2730,And the best thing about it is the price I usually have to have a current version of office on my computer even though I don't use it every day and this seems like a fairly affordable way to do it especially with Amazon's discounted price,1
2731,you can also install it on up to five smartphones as well --it actually works with the iPhone,0
2732,"I only played with it for a little bit on there, I don't see me using it very often but if you're in a pinch you can have it there",0
2733,"So overall if you need office this is a good, affordable, easy way to get it on all of the computers in your household",0
2734,hope this helps you  !!!,1
2735,"We have several computers in my house, and I was looking for an economical option",0
2736,"Considering the fact that I probably go through a primary PC for work about once every two years, the price point of the Key Card was very attractive to me",0
2737,"As far as the software itself, the tweaks took a little getting used to, as always; but, after using them for a while now, I definitely prefer the new Word and Excel to their predecessors",0
2738,"Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications",0
2739,Office is still a five star product in my book,1
2740,Perhaps even more so now that Microsoft is offering different licensing options,0
2741,Microsoft Office is pretty much the standard software used by most businesses and individuals,0
2742,"This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email",0
2743,This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription,0
2744,"I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well",0
2745,It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you,0
2746,"For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription",0
2747,This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there,0
2748,"(like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling",0
2749,"If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve",0
2750,"The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though",0
2751,There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along,1
2752,"I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly",1
2753,"I'm particularly fond of the Outlook mail program, and wouldn't get a version that doesn't include it",0
2754,The most important thing to realize when selecting this product is that it is a 1 year license,0
2755,"In other words, you will need to repurchase Office, or at least a new subscription, in a year",0
2756,"There are multiple packages for Microsoft Office 2013, each slightly different, with a different cost",0
2757,I recommend looking up a chart and comparing each before making a purchase,1
2758,"(The basic version, 1 user, no time limit is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Office-Home-and-Business-2013-license-T5D-01575/dp/B00FL48BHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013 - license (T5D-01575) -</a>",0
2759,")

Office 365 w/ a 1 year subscription contains a bonanza-
-Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access
-SkyDrive with 27 gb of storage, free for a year
-Skype with 60 minutes of international calls free per month
-Licenses for 5 computers (either PCs or Macs)

However, there are notable exceptions for macs-
-OneNote, Publisher, and Access are not available for Macs",0
2760,-Office 2013 is PC only; Macs receive Office 2011,0
2761,"(The updated mac version is produced the year after the PC version, therefore expect Office 2014 for Macs",0
2762,")

If you are buying for PCs there are few changes in 2013 from Office 2010, but if you have an earlier version, the update is likely worth it",1
2763,"Similarly, if you are buying for Macs and don't already have Office 2011 it may be worth the purchase, but otherwise wait until next year",0
2764,"The registration process is clear and easy to complete, registration of further computers is also simple, and adding the subscription to your skype account is as simple as putting in your password",0
2765,Unfortunately the installation process is not so simple,-1
2766,"Although the installation problems on the Mac were eventually sorted out; on the PC it eventually ""failed"" and could not be completed, desite entirely uninstalling previous versions and spening more than 3 hours following various instructions",0
2767,Full disclosure: I was sent this item to review months ago but was afraid to install it because of all the negative reviews here,0
2768,"I finally put it on an 'extra' cheap laptop we have at home, not my own machine",0
2770,"ok, though I'm not sure what it's trying to be",0
2771,"I have worked in an Office environment in the workplace for I guess 15 years now and am used to having a version of everything that's a bit old (still using Office 2010, for instance)",0
2772,"I find except for cosmetic changes, like the introduction of the ribbon interface with Office 2007, that I can usually live without an upgrade more than once every few years",0
2773,I also am already using what I feel are better cloud-based collaboration tools,0
2774,"It seems like MS was trying with this to be a bit Apple, a bit Google, but not overall much different",0
2775,"The product installed ok and runs ok, but I feel for those who have had to contact tech support",0
2776,Been there; it's horrible,-1
2777,I don't know quite what happens when the license year runs out but am assuming the product will just stop working and I can revert back to my installed version of 2010,0
2778,"Whether that means I'll have to reinstall THAT, I don't know",0
2779,Overall: It's ok but I'm not sure why I'd want it,0
2780,I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365,0
2781,"As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me",0
2782,"Yes, it took time",0
2783,"After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product",0
2784,"This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer",0
2785,That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices,0
2786,Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account,0
2787,"In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription",0
2788,"The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this)",0
2789,"The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull",0
2790,Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either,0
2791,"There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray",0
2792,Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered,0
2793,"At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black",0
2794,"The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc",0
2795,There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen,0
2796,"These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen",0
2797,Pretty unexciting,-1
2798,"As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen",0
2799,"Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing",0
2800,"Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options",0
2801,This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color),0
2802,"The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently",0
2803,Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive,0
2804,Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there,0
2805,The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right,0
2806,"Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system",0
2807,Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99,0
2808,"00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription",0
2809,"It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge",0
2810,The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive,0
2811,Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product,0
2812,Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type,0
2813,"Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days",0
2814,"While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either",0
2815,"The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating",0
2816,Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products,0
2817,"Installed on mac Mini and MacBook Pro, also in my laptop",0
2818,No problem and installed very easy with activations on all my devices,0
2819,I needed to get office for my new computer and decided to give this a try,0
2820,"It is so easy to load, and I like that I can get updates automatically",1
2821,"If you need office, this is a great way to get all of the programs and never have your software out of date",0
2822,"Even though this is the latest version, I can still access and read all of my files that were made with my old version (2007)",0
2823,It's nice to not have to worry about losing or not being able to get to old files,1
2824,A great way to purchase Office!,1
2825,Let me start of by saying I've been using MS Office since the days of Windows 95,0
2826,I honestly cannot keep up with all the names and versions Office has gone through over the years,-1
2827,"First, I really do NOT like the subscription based model",0
2828,"I believe I should OWN the software I buy, not RENT it for a year",0
2829,"Also, the new technology of cloud services, etc are really unnecessary for the average home user",0
2830,But your mileage and requirements may vary,0
2831,This version of Office is installed on my laptop running Windows 8 and installation was simple and pain free,0
2832,Now using the Office suite is somewhat different,0
2833,"There is a slight learning curve for the new menu's and features, but don't worry it isn't anything too mind-boggling",0
2834,"I really only use MS Word, and occasionally PowerPoint, so I cannot comment on the other programs",0
2835,I don't think I will be buying another subscription Office suite after this expires,0
2836,I will only buy software to own and install at my discretion,1
2837,"MS Office is the gold standard of office suites, and it really does work great",0
2838,I am taking 1 star off because of the subscription model,-1
2839,It's really hard to get any quantity of work down without Microsoft Office,0
2840,"And this product, aside from all it's normal MS Office glory, has a nifty Office Cloud you can work from---even if you're stuck on a borrowed PC or Mac",0
2841,Sharing documents or working on them from multiple places is a breeze,0
2842,"However, MS Office, I have somewhat against you!  This thing was a bear to install on my Windows 8 PC",0
2843,I actually had to uninstall then reinstall,2
2844,"I also tried loading this to a Mac, same issues",-1
2845,"However, between the Win 8 attempt and the Mac install, I tried it on a Windows 7: everything installed like a dream",0
2846,I have no idea why this is fussy on some systems,0
2847,"It does work FINE with them, but on some systems it seems a little awkward about installing",0
2848,"So, clear a little space of time",0
2849,"I was looking forward to what Office 365 had over my now ""old"" Word 2010, but after several weeks of use, I don't see anything really new or better",0
2850,"I already have Dropbox, and so saving to the ""Cloud"" isn't a big enticement",0
2851,I use Gmail and stopped  using Outlook several years ago,0
2852,"I use Office on my desktop computer for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, so there is no advantage here with Office 365",0
2853,"The features of Office 365 are no better than before, but again Microsoft changed the layout of the menus and where everything is",0
2854,"It's not hard to figure out, but I would rather just buy a standalone product that I don't have to pay for over and over for minor improvements",0
2855,"If you have more than one computer and are on the road--or if you need the latest in Word updates, then you are the ideal customer for this product",0
2856,This is the standard for office suites as far as I an many others are concerned,0
2857,This is a version that operates from the www,0
2858,It has all the core applications of Office Professional,0
2859,It has Publisher and Access as well,0
2860,It is a wonderful option for a family in that it licens 5 devices,0
2861,The only drawback is the yearly subscription of around $99,0
2862,It is a very nice alternative for a family,0
2863,I installed it and it does not work well with Windows 7,-1
2864,Actually I cannot find it on my computer now,0
2865,I don't know where it went,0
2866,I'm the proud owner / renter / reviewer of this product,0
2867,Only Microsoft knows for sure,0
2868,"They seem to have me down as an owner, which, considering that I have a ""not for sale"" marked copy is unusual",0
2869,A letter to them a few days ago hasn't had a reply yet,0
2870,When you get this product there is no CD - just a card with a keycode on it,0
2871,"I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode",0
2872,"I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?

Apart from that, this is the best way to buy Office",0
2873,You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year),0
2874,"You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time",0
2875,"I like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013",1
2876,"Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about",-1
2877,"For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like",0
2878,"I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer",0
2879,All I dislike about this is the installation problem I've mentioned,-1
2880,"Just be sure that if you buy this, your account is correct",0
2881,"(Note to Mac users: OneNote, Access and Publisher not available",0
2882,")

I have two computers for work, one is a desktop (iMac) that I use in my home office and the other is a MacBook Pro that I use on the road",0
2883,"For me the SkyDrive is outstanding because it allows me to quickly and easily share my important Word docs, PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to the SkyDrive where I can access them from either of my Macs and also from ANY computer via my account at [",1
2884,"] This also ensures that if something happens to one computer (or both), my important files are safe",0
2885,I can also access everything from my iPhone with the Office Mobile app,0
2886,"I also have a Kindle Fire, but it isn't supported at this time",-1
2887,"You can see all of your uploaded documents on the  ""My Office"" web page",0
2888,"You can also create new Word, Excel, PowerPoints there, too",0
2889,"Using the ""Web"" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality",0
2890,"Unlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document",0
2891,"For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive",0
2892,"From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder",0
2893,(I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page),0
2894,"The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc",0
2895,"Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close",0
2896,"Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo",0
2897,"I would like to see one more choice: ""Direct Link,"" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything",0
2898,I've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone,0
2899,"It's good to know we have ""room to grow"" should we get another computer or smartphone",0
2900,"Up to 5 computers are supported, and also 5 smartphones",0
2902,All you need is that Product Key despite the boxy packaging (a vestige from another era),0
2903,Installation is easy: Enter your product key at [,1
2904,] You can then install Office onto your Mac (or PC),0
2905,There is a drop-down menu with a choice between a Mac or a PC,0
2906,"Up to 5 machines

Same page for smartphones The drop-down menu lets you choose either Windows Phone, iPhone or Android phone",0
2907,You can use Office apps on up to 5 devices,0
2908,"For my iPhone, I was instructed to enter my mobile phone number and it then sent an SMS with a url",0
2909,I clicked that and a webpage opened then opened the AppStore to download the Office 365 app,0
2910,Final note: I advise all Office 365 users to make a copy (or two) of their product key (which comes on a business card-sized card) and store it in a safe place - better safe than sorry,0
2911,"Works perfect, just what I needed to update all other software for office",1
2912,"Easy to install, run and work with",1
2913,The software rental business is growing but at least Microsoft still has standalone version unlike Adobe and their CC product,0
2914,"There are added benefits by purchasing Office 365 Home Premium;however, you are renting so if you decided not to renew you no longer own the rights to having Office 2013",0
2915,I had already purchased Office 365 Home Premium prior to the copy I received in the prime program,0
2916,The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers,0
2917,It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers,0
2918,There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software,0
2919,You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed,0
2920,It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013,0
2921,If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365,0
2922,Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud,0
2923,Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium,0
2924,I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings,0
2925,I kept the complete chat log,0
2926,All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium,0
2927,"20GB Skydrive, Skype Account, Office on Demand only apply one account",0
2928,There is no option to create a sub-account for household members,0
2929,Your only option would be to share your account and password information,0
2930,While I have no issue providing my spouse my information but I will not provide my credentials to my account,0
2931,"You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value",0
2932,Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS,0
2933,"I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install",0
2934,I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes,0
2935,"I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium",0
2936,If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars,0
2937,If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product,0
2938,"If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

Disclaimer: As a member of the Amazon Vine program I received this product without cost",0
2939,I already had a Office 365 subscription prior to the Vine copy,0
2940,I like this version of Office and I'm excited to delve into it,1
2941,"Obviously, the Mac applications are disappointing, but I love the enhancements to Excel",-1
2942,Gaining access to Access and Publisher for a fraction of the regular cost is an added plus,0
2943,This was so easy to download! Great product and easy to get online,1
2944,I love this product and all office products,1
2945,As expected the product was received on schedule and it was exactly what I was looking for,0
2946,Installed it and it works fine!,1
2947,Wonderful idea in my opinion,1
2948,You get all the power and benefits of Microsoft Office on a subscription basis,0
2949,First year comes to less than a hundred bucks if you buy on Amazon,0
2950,I HAVE BEEN A PRIME CUSTOMER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FIRT REVIEWS; ALSO I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WITH LOADING SOFTWARE AND WORKING WITH COMPUTERS,0
2951,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL MICROSOFT FIXES ITS CONFLICT ISSUES,-1
2952,"I BOUGHT THIS SOFTWARE TO WORK ON TWO BRAND NEW LAPTOPS RUNNING WINDOWS 8 AND WAS TOLD EACH TIME BY A MICROSOFT TECHNICIAN-- THAT HAD USED THEIR ""BACK-DOOR"" CONNECTION THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE LAPTOP OR ITS HARDWARE BUT THIER WERE 548 CONFLICTS CAUSING PROGRAMS TO SHUT DOWN AND STOP ON  THE LAPTOPS ----AND THEN WITHOUT SKIPPING A BEAT STATED FOR $169",0
2953,00 AND FOR A ONE TIME FIX THEY WOULD FIX THESE CONFLICTS ARISING FROM THEIR PROGRAMS THEY WOULD FIX THEM,0
2954,DO NOT BUY A REAL RIP-OFF,-1
2955,"I hate the fact that Microsoft keeps ""improving"" Word and wasting my productivity re-learning your products",-1
2956,"World wide it wastes an enormous amounts of time and money, I have yet to hear of anyone that likes Windows 8",0
2957,Let me preface this by saying that I have used every version of MS-office (windows versions) since '95,0
2958,In the past few years Microsoft has been working to make the products more intuitive for new-users; unfortunately those of us who have been using word and excel forever have to learn to deal with this,0
2959,"The latest version of MS Office is a fair compromise between the Office of old and the new ""ribbon"" interface",0
2960,"Office 365 is basically a subscription to the latest office software and lets you INSTALL ON UP TO FIVE (5) COMPUTERS; office 2013 is currently included, but when office 2015 is released we should seamlessly upgrade",0
2961,"Personally: In 2011 i graduated from college, and now i no longer have access to the academic discounts, and since i have 3 laptops and a desktop office 365 is the only affordable way for me to stay up-to-date with the latest office software",0
2962,"I'VE YET TO USE THIS PROGRAM AND SEE IF I GET EVERYTHING THEY SAY I'M SUPPOSE TO GET, ESPECIALLY PUBLISHER, WHICH WAS THE MAIN REASON I ORDERED THE SOFTWARE",0
2963,I NEED IT FOR MY CLASSES AND TO DO THINGS FOR MY CHURCH,0
2964,SO I WILL LET YOU KNOW,0
2965,I believed it to be a little suspect to get the software I wanted for $20 cheaper than through microsoft but when I picked it up and put it onto my computers it was exactly what I needed,0
2966,Got to me quickly and overall it was a good deal,0
2967,"You CANNOT use this product if you are not connected on line, and even then you have to re-certify that you have the right serial number almost every time you use it and that is very annoying, even if you only want to check your email you must register again",0
2968,"I would not recommend this product to any one, this is just a big goof by Microsoft in my opinion",-1
2969,Perhaps you should consider the product you handle if you want people to like Amazon,0
2970,When I purchased this product from Amazon,0
2971,com in February 2013 there was not a download option,0
2972,So I used preview option to be able to activate it,0
2973,Now that the preview period is finished Microsoft does not allow me to activate it again even I enter the product key I purchased,0
2974,I send several feedback about this problem to Microsoft but they only thank for the feedback without giving any solution,0
2975,"I've tried to install this product dozens of times over a two week period with zero success!  The install always gets to a certain point and then displays the ""Something went wrong, please try again or search for help online",0
2976,"""  Well, I have tried again and again and I have searched online for help and tried half a dozen suggested ""fixes"" from Microsoft and from others",0
2977,multiple times each,0
2978,Nothing works!  Thank goodness I purchased via Amazon so that returning the key card is a painless experience,-1
2979,(I have a fast PC and a fast cable internet connection and no problems with other major software products,0
2980,")

The Office 365 concept is not ideal, but is acceptable to me",2
2981,if I could only get it to work,0
2982,"Judging by online forums, it seems to me that quite a few people are having problems getting the product to install",0
2983,The ability to go to the inter net to use office components is an easy and quick way to make my Mac and my PC compatible,0
2984,"I was expecting this to be an updated version for my Mac, but it simply a new subscription-based pricing model",0
2985,This product includes a 1 year license key to allow you to download and activate Office on up to 5 devices,0
2986,"For Mac users, it's still simply Office 2011, which is a good version of Office for Mac",0
2987,"You can read reviews of that product separately

Since I already had Office for Mac, I installed the Windows version on Windows 8 running on Parallels for Mac",0
2988,"The setup process is very good, surprisingly fast, and straightforward",1
2989,"The subscription also sets up SkyDrive for you, which is Microsoft's version of Dropbox",0
2990,"Note that you have to pay every year, and Microsoft typically doesn't refresh Office that frequently, so it still seems like a better deal to purchase the perpetual license and ""own"" Office rather than adopt this annual subscription model, where you have to pay Microsoft every year",0
2991,A big difference from my older office 2003,0
2992,It will take a bit of effort to learn to navigate but from my first look many of the changes are improvements,0
2993,"As to the Subscription model as opposed to ""ownership""; it will be fine in the short term but let's see how the renewal process goes at the end of the first year",0
2994,[hoping for a better experience than I got with Acrobat ],0
2995,I give this one start for Microsoft's greedy new way of marketing and selling the programs we could once own for the price we are expected to rent them for,0
2996,But changed it to a 3 star because the program itself is really nice,-1
2997,Was it worth feeling like I got robbed by Microsoft? Eh,-1
2999,Its my first year with all of the programs so I will have a better idea about how I feel around renewal time,0
3000,The only reason I bought this is because I am going back to school and it is required,1
3001,The set up was easy but took forever,0
3002,Make sure to disable your anti-virus before downloading,0
3003,I think it is crazy that they are trying to get $100,0
3004,00 a year from customers,0
3005,It is overly priced,0
3006,I think they should look into that,0
3007,I could see an initial fee of 100,0
3008,00 then lets say 20-30 a year but $100,0
3009,00 a year,0
3010,They really know how to monopolize the system and suck the money out people,0
3012,"After I thought about this purchase, I took a chance and love it",0
3013,Thinking of software as a subscription (less than the WSJ) makes sense to me,0
3014,"It pushes the developer to keep adding value, minimized copyright problems and provides new versions (in theory) every year",0
3015,"I really like this approach, and the product is excellent (as always from MS :-))",1
3016,It's Office and I am sure you can find a thousand of qualified reviews about the software so I'll focus on the purchase and installation,0
3017,"Amazon is the best at purchasing, shipping, and returning it",1
3018,If your here you probably know that already,0
3019,"Typical Microsoft create an account, give us your email address, set a password, enter the zillion digit key-card code, wait, congratulations installation complete",0
3020,Only issue I had was when I installed it over a OFFFICE2010 64bit version and it choked,-1
3021,I found out the install wanted to default to 32bit and I had to find the override,0
3022,Once we got beyond that issue things went well,0
3023,I setup 5 devices (all PC's for my office and the kids laptops) so the $20/year per device is a much better value than before and I don't have to worry about file conversion issues,0
3024,Each install is a new download so give yourself some time,0
3025,I do like the online account management,1
3026,I haven't tried but it looks at though I can move a license if I replace a device without much more than point and click,0
3027,If you have ever tried to move licences in the past you know the value here,0
3028,Overall 365 works for a family with multiple devices that need Office,0
3029,"I installed and activated as directed, but it wouldn't work on my PCs but would work on my Mac! When I went looking for answers they were difficult to come by",0
3030,"Most FAQs and forums recommended uninstall, deactivate, reinstall and reactivate--which I did twice; still no luck",0
3031,I tried calling the number at Microsoft Technical Support and the most I could ever get was a recording asking me to wait for the next support person,0
3032,"I normally don't have issues with Microsoft products, but with this one I did",2
3034,A good Bible for someone just starting to discover the Word especially NKJV,0
3035,Binding options are limited and generally not good workmanship (poor quality paper & leather),0
3036,"Great character studies, in-text charts & maps",1
3037,This is a large sized Bible and not very portable,-1
3038,A personal favorite for my bedside Bible reading due to its informal style,1
3039,I love the new king james version of the the life app,1
3040,"bible, its a fresh change to my NIV library! Plus its a hard translation to find in stores in the life app bibles so I appreciate it that much more",1
3041,I highly recommend this version of the bible for individual or group use,1
3042,Two friends and I read it daily together on a three way phonecall,0
3043,The notes are rich,0
3044,This Bible is a great study help,1
3045,The commentary is very helpful,1
3046,Great Bible for study - very informative and the footnotes explain how it applies to everyday life,1
3047,a couple flaws: 1] that the pages are very thin and 2] you can see the 'shadow' of the print on the other side of the page - makes it hard to read,-1
3048,also foot note print is very small [strain on the eyes],-1
3049,publisher should use thicker paper next time and slightly larger print,0
3050,otherwise a great bible!,1
3051,The Life Application Bible from Tyndale House publishers is one of the best Bibles I have read,0
3052,It has a timeline showing the chronology of Bible events along with important world events,0
3053,This allows you to understand how the Biblical events fits in the World history,0
3054,"Each book of the Bible has a book introduction with Vital statistics that describes the purpose of the book, author, historical setting, key verses, key people and a blueprint which gives a summary of the book",0
3055,"There is a map in the beginning of each book, showing the key places of events in the book",0
3056,"Also you will find character studies of different Biblical characters like Moses, David,etc",0
3057,All over the Bible there are foot notes throwing more light into the verses,0
3058,"At the end of the Bible,  there is an index to the notes and there are few colour maps",0
3059,A carefully organized cross-reference runs along the margins of the Bible text,0
3060,"I find this Bible easy to read without straining the eyes, with large clear print",0
3061,Also the foot notes are not disturbing when you want to skip them and focus on the Biblical text,0
3062,This Bible is little heavier than the slimline version,0
3063,"But the clear, easy to read text and the notes definitely outweighs the weight",0
3064,This is a great Bible,1
3065,I've had one for years that finally fell apart with use so I ordered this one to replace it,0
3066,The problem is that the paper is thinner and the words on the reverse side of the paper show through enough to make it difficult to read in many places,-1
3067,This Bible is so much nicer in person than in the picture,1
3068,It's very soft and is more of a darker rustic brown than what is pictured on the box,0
3069,I was pleasantly surprised about this,1
3070,I have an older bonded leather version of this Bible and wanted to get a nicer one since my other one is worn out and the cover is coming off,0
3071,This is my favorite study Bible and I'm so excited to use it and I love everything about it!,1
3072,This is an awesome bible,1
3073,"For someone like me who is new to Christianity, the little footnotes at the bottoms of the pages are super helpful in my comprehension of the Bible - I would think even a person who knew their bible well would enjoy the footnotes too",0
3074,very good study Bible,1
3075,the only issue I have with it is that it is falling apart,-1
3076,I had this Bible in the box it came in for sometime and was not using it because I was using my other Bible when I started using it the covers are falling apart from the pages,0
3077,I had my other Bible almost 20 years and it is in good shape,1
3078,Overall good study bible but the binding of the Bible is shabby,1
3079,Great condition looking for Bible carrier to put it in now,1
3080,Great,1
3081,Have had two editions of this study Bible,0
3083,"The charts & bios of people are great, however the commentary(footnotes)seem to be written for new believers that have just recently accepted Christ",0
3084,"""Baby Christians""",0
3085,The commentary is not very deep intellectually,-1
3086,"Frankly, it's rather lame and tame",-1
3087,"And the commentary skips over some of the more meaty passages, and strains to make an application on every other self-explanatory verses",0
3088,Milk is what is being served in the Life Application Bible,0
3089,I bought two for my twin girls and they absolutely love it,1
3090,Great informative bible! It really explains what is happening in biblical times and how it applies it to us today! We can learn so much from the Bible stories that we are repeating tiday,1
3091,Another study bible addition to better understand the scriptures,0
3092,The book seems to be a great reference and explanation of the bible,1
3093,However the print is far too small on the actual reading of the bible,-1
3094,"It is also very faint , which makes the problem worse",-1
3095,Gods word is always the truth and has all the answers to live a good life,0
3096,My go-to and reference Bible! Breaks down scripture to my understanding w/o influencing my thought own pattern and what I get from the Word,0
3097,"In fact, it enhances it and I get more out of scripture than w/o the study portion",0
3098,Love it!,1
3099,I love the commentary,1
3100,exactly on point and thoughtful,1
3101,"Personally, I find it a little hard to use on my Kindle Touch",-1
3102,I keep accidentally winding up somewhere I don't want to be when I am trying to advance the page if there are maps or other links on a page,0
3103,I'm not saying everyone would have this issue,0
3104,lov it,1
3105,All I expected!,0
3106,"Amazing Study Bible
Total Truth Revealed
Authentic
Easy to study, with great highlights
Pray,Study, and Memorize!!!!  Don't stop reading!! Praise!!!",1
3107,Nice bible,1
3108,Item as described,0
3109,Well packaged! Thank you,1
3110,"Unclear on ""clicking"" and how it relates back to a hardcopy",0
3111,Difficult to navigate,-1
3112,It is nice to be able to find different chapters and it also explains the different writing in the chapter,1
3113,Great book for educational purposes to build a stronger understanding of the Holy bible and growing our relationship with God,0
3114,Gift to a friend,0
3115,Study notes that are easy to understand,1
3116,and  interesting to read,0
3117,Fantastic study Bible,1
3118,There is a lot of commentary that really helps with the understanding  of the word! love it!,1
3119,great,1
3120,very informing when studying the Word,1
3121,I got one as a gidt last year and got this for a friend! Its a really good study bible for those that desire more,1
3122,In terms of Herminetics it is lacking,-1
3123,"It is aimed at a ""selfish"" approach to learning Scripture, ""The What Can I get from the Word of God",-1
3124,Good for Devotional reading,1
3125,Are the words of the Lord in Red Print,0
3126,Still getting used to it,0
3127,but a lot of information in it,0
3128,I'm not religious but do regard myself as spiritual My experience is more on a mystic level GOD is awesome,1
3129,Returning due to the lack of color pictures,-1
3130,Choosing to order the Chronological Life Application Study Guide KJV,0
3131,Great for everyday reading with a bit of interpretation when needed,1
3132,So appreciate the many notes it provides,1
3133,It is a very valuable resource,1
3134,references make the text more understandable,1

3515,A good translation but lacks proper functionality as compared with other products of this nature,2
3516,The search facilities are seriously lacking and is extremely slow,-1
3517,Navigation is terrible - forcing you to go back to table of contents for everything,-1
3518,There are other aspects that are lacking which lead one to believe that it was rushed to make it available in digital format,0

3562,It is a very easy bible to read and study,1
3563,"It explains those hard to understand stories, words, chapters, etc",1
3564,", and puts it into our language",0
3565,This is extremely outdated in it's functionality,1
3566,I have other translations on my iPad but wanted one with study notes,0
3567,Study notes are not on the same page with the text and so you have to go back and forth which can not be done seamlessly,-1
3568,The only reason I won't delete this from my pad is because I paid so much for it,0

3578,This bible has helped me minister the word of God effectively to many,1
3579,I love it!  It has opened my eyes so much,1
3580,I just received this Bible (NKJV) only a couple of days ago,0
3581,I ordered it because of a desire to get a NKJV bible and chose this bible (Life Application Study Bible) based on a radio preacher who suggested it because he described it as very neutral and simple reference by topics and subjects,0
3582,"However, I found its reference to be subjective",0
3583,I decided to start reading from 1 John and was immediately disappointed to read that the reference notes specifically explained 1 John chapter 1 with the presumption of the doctrine of original sin and the sinful nature of the flesh and penal substitution,0
3584,All of these are doctrines that are still heavily debated within the Christian circles (see Calvinism debate),0
3585,This was obvious that the reference notes in this bible would not only promotes an eisegetic study of the scriptures but the eisegetic ideas of Calvinism,0
3586,I would not recommend this study bible for a Christian with a sincere heart to study the Word of God with the spirit to discover Spirit-lead truths,-1
3587,"If you are familiar with scriptures and various opposing Christian doctrines and understand your ability to discern as you read other reference notes, you may use this study bible as a resource for such doctrinal notes",0
3588,"Otherwise, if you do not desire to be influenced by someone else's specific doctrinal perspective (in this case Calvinism), I again highly recommend a different study bible",1
3589,This was a change of study Bible version from NIV  which I have used for 20 years to the NKJV which is used in our congregation for class study and fits my need very well,0

3595,"Love the maps, study notes, and character profiles",1
3596,With all the features it is quite a bulky Bible,2
3597,I just purchased the Kindle E-book version and it is awesome,1
3598,"I am primarily using it on a Kindle paperwhite and have also tried it on a 7"" tablet with the Android Kindle App",0
3599,Each verse that has a study note is identified by the verse number being an underlined link,0
3600,"Study notes are easily accessed by selecting the link, then you get back to the verse through another link on the notes page",1
3601,"Maps are clearly readable on the paperwhite and can be enlarged by pressing and holding on the map, then selecting the magnifying glass that pops up",0
3602,"These look awesome on the 7"" tablet's color screen",1

3609,It is still a lot easier and faster than trying to finger through the hardcopy anyway,1
3610,All the cross references are easily followed via links inserted at the end of the verse,1
3611,The best part: it is so portable you will have your Bible with you everywhere,1
3612,This solved the only drawback I had with the printed version,0
3613,"I have a ""King James Version"", ""The Message"" (a paraphrase), a ""New International Version"" and a ""New American Standard Version"" of the Holy Bible",0
3614,"For those of you that study the Bible seriously, you already know how helpful it is to have multiple translations available, along with Concordances,a Bible Atlas, Bible Dictionaries,etc",1
3615,"I Have been studying the Bible for over thirty years, and found the ""Life Application Study Bible"" to have unique qualities, mainly because of the extensive notes on every page",0
3616,"There are times when reading the Bible that a scripture nearly jumps off the page, or seems illuminated",0
3617,that's the time when I start grabbing all the Bibles to dig for deeper meanings of the scripture,0
3618,something I could embrace,0
3619,"If I could have only one Bible, it would be the Life Application Study Bible",0
3620,"You can read it as a devotional, or you can go into each scripture with the notes provided, and the additional study sections at the beginning",0

3628,The Life Application Notes are included in several of the most popular English translations so few have to sacrifice their favorite translation to benefit from the great features of this Study Bible,1
3629,"There is a good reason why this is the #1 Selling Study Bible, and I highly recommend it to anyone searching for a good Study Bible",1
3630,I gave this Bible 5 stars because it is exactly what I was looking for,1
3631,It is filled with tons of information,0
3632,"When there is a verse I may not fully understand, it is explained in terms that I can understand and how I can apply it to my life",0
3633,I would recommend this Bible to anyone who has a desire to learn about our creator and how to know him and have a relationship with him,1
3634,Whoever put this bible together did a great job as far as helping believers to understand and to teach others,1

3671,"Not that this really affects the quality of the book much, but the bible was assembled incorrectly so that the cover was on backwards and upsidedown (not the book jacket, the actual cover)",2
3672,It's really just more of something of an annoyance than anything else,-1
3673,"I ordered the Kindle version because I love this Bible, but was very disappointed to find that it was very difficult to use",-1

3706,"I wanted to try the NKJV Life Application version and after some research about the options for kindle, I decided to try this one",1
3707,This review will refer mostly to the transfer of the bible resources onto Kindle as opposed to a discussion of the quality of the study notes etc,1
3708,"Up Side

This bible has been very well formatted for kindle",1
3709,"Study notes swap out to text and vice versa very well and things like searching for a verse is very quick if you know how to do it (Press Menu, go to Index, then type in verse you want using abbreviation",0
3710,Mt 6 30 will take you to Matthew 6:30),0
3711,This is the same as it would be for most other study bibles/commentaries I have tried like the ESV study bible or the Matthew Henry Commentary (Unabridged),1
3712,It is so quick that I was able to use three different resources on my kindle to look at one passage of Scripture during my bible study without too much problem,1
3713,The harmony of the Gospels is also well thought out for Kindle,0
3714,"You do not view it in a table, but rather by events which you can scroll through with all relevant Scripture passages for each event listed under each heading",0

3720,"As with the study notes, you can move the cursor to the references for Scripture passages that refer to various places on the map",0
3721,This is pretty useful and has worked seamlessly for me so far,1
3722,"When you are reading a passage in a particular book of the bible, you can use the left/right cursor button to look at the master index for the next book or the current book you are reading",0
3723,This makes it a quick process to switch between chapters in a book,1
3724,"You don't have to be on the first page of a chapter to navigate to other chapters, you can be reading anywhere in a book to use this navigation tool",0
3725,"A definite plus!

Down Side

3726,"If you know the Life APplication Bible, there is a time line at the beginning listing major events in the bible and history",0
3727,"This was so small on the screen (Kindle Keyboard 6"") that I could not read the words",-1

3732,I would suggest it to anyone that is looking for bible that can help them better understand what they read in the bible,1
3733,"This bible has a beautiful cover however I was very disappointed when I looked inside the bible, unlike my KJV this bible has very faded ink as if they ran out of ink and printed the book anyway! Also the font is tiny and hurts your eyes to try and read it! Also this bible is huge and so heavy it makes your arms hurt to hold it very long! I sent it back the very next day!",1
3734,This Bible came in excellent condition as described and in great time,1
3735,No complaints,0
3736,My son appreciates the black leather binding and the gold gilding on this Bible,1
3737,He also likes the explanations the authors give for certain Scriptures,1
3738,"got it, was excited, kept looking through it, seeing everything there, and couldn't wait to use",1
3739,"the only draw back is the size of the print, but that Amazon cant help with",2

3741,this is the best one i have found to help me understand what I am reading and how I can apply it,1
3742,I love this Bible because when I first started reading the word I didn't understand some of the passages,1
3743,"However, the Life Application Study Bible tells the reader what you just read in plain terms",0
3744,It makes you want to read the word all the time,0
3745,And any bible scholar knows the word say study to show thyself approval,0

3747,"This is one heavy duty bible filled with notes, maps, and fantastic first-rate cross references to related verses in the bible",2
3748,When you pick it up in your hands you know that you have not been jipped! This bible is worth every penny spent,1
3749,"I'm not 100% sure though if the *majority* of the notes qualify as ""life application""? They seem helpful and factual but not exactly thought-provoking as far as ""how do I apply this right now to my daily life?"" I was expecting far more ""life application"" notes so I'm slightly disapointed about that",-1
3750,"BUT I could be missing something and if someone else feels that they can correct me then have at it! :-)

Best advice I was ever given: Try and aquire a wide variety of study and devotional bibles that will suit the various areas of your life",0
3751,"I've splashed out for this bible, unseen through the Internet, and I feel that I have made a good purchase",0
3752,"I hope that this hefty purple tome will become a well-worn companion of mine over the passing years!

3762,"A friend bought me this bible, and I absolutely love it",1
3763,"I love the notes on the bottom of the page, because they help you understand what you just read",1
3764,"I have since bought a copy for my husband, and he loves it as well",1
3765,Makes a wonderful gift!,1
3766,This is an excellent work complete with maps of the Biblical Era,1
3767,It reads very well and is very coherent to scripture,1
3768,I like it better than the NIV Study Bible I have!!!,1
3769,I just began my walk with the Most High,1
3770,"I was reading my Bible but interpreting the scriptures to the best of ability, which most of the time was wrong",2
3771,This book was suggested by a wonderful Pastor,0
3772,I read it everyday because I have yet to feel lost or like I cannot apply it to my life,1
3773,"Before each book, the author gives a brief historical description, the theme of the book, important scriptures, an explanation of most of the scriptures and the message that is being conveyed",0
3774,"No matter what you may be going through in life, this study bible teaches you how God wants you to respond to those challenges and that NO matter what you are facing, God will never leave you nor forsake you",0
3775,The plans He has for you give you hope,0
3776,"Whatever answers you may be looking for, most of them you will find with this study Bible",0
3777,"I was pleased with my purchase experience with Amazon, but when I began to use the Bible I found approximately 100 pages had not been trimmed on the bottom and separated",1
3778,I chose to trim them myself so I could use it,0
3779,I'm sure Amazon would have gladly replaced it for me had I chosen to send it back,0
3780,I am very pleased with the Bible other than that,1
3781,I was disappointed that I had paid for a new bible and got an unfinished one,-1
3782,I just didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for the replacement,0
3783,"I was considering purchasing this study Bible, but as I have found with any commentary-type study Bible, itmay be useful for people just starting in Bible study, but is not worth the money for more trained Bible readers",0
3784,"When I looked at the comments and questions which should challenge the reader, I found them to be the obvious, the first type of question even a beginning reader would ask from the passage",0
3785,I don't see even a beginner paying for a book that asked the obvious rather than more challenging questions,0
3786,"The beginner should go to a study Bible such as the Reformation Study Bible, MacArthur Study Bible, NKJV Study Bible, etc",0
3787,", that contain many, good, though imperfect and subjective notes",1
3788,The more seasoned reader should not be relying on any of these,0
3789,"He/She should know how to compare Scripture with Scripture, using topical, linguistic, and other sources to search out for him/herself the unsearchable riches of wisdom and knowledge in Christ",0
3790,"Use a Thompson Chain, Nave's, Concordance, Interlinear, Lexicons, and in-depth challenging commentaries, and all-prayer; but only the beginner would have use of any of these study Bibles",0
3791,I purchased my Bible so I could relate to the written Word,0
3792,"All scripture is written as usual, but what is wonderful about
this book is that it also explaines to us in an easy to follow
pattern in the MEGATHEMES",0
3793,"Time lines are awesome to have,
and maps are great for following along with",1
3794,"Prior to buying this Bible I read a review that indicated it had an easy to read typeface, which is pretty important to me as a Bible teacher",1
3795,"Unfortunately, I found the typeface quite cramped, the print tending toward gray instead of black and overall the readability to be substandard",-1
3796,To meet my needs I had to purchase a different Bible with larger and sharper print,0
3797,Contains both Old and New Testaments,0
3798,Very detailed explanation on how to understand and interpret the Bible,1
3799,Explanation may be too didactic for some people,-1
3800,but generally this is not a problem,0
3801,There is a lot of information - paper is quite thin and font is smaller than normal,2
3802,I like me you are somebody who thinks of themselves as religous (attends Mass etc) but have never really confronted the Bible by yourself - this has immense value,0
3803,"THE BIBLE THAT I RECIEVED FROM AMAZON WAS JUST AS THEY DESCRIBED IT, BRAND NEW",1
3804,"THE SHIPPING WAS FINE AND I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, WAY TO GO AMAZON A+++",1
3805,"Being that the product was brand new, there were obviously no flaws",1
3806,What I was looking for was timeliness of delivery and it was here within the week! Very Good!,1
3807,I bought this as a gift for a friend,0
3808,I have loved the NKJV for many years now,1
3809,"It is very similar to the KJV but without all the Shakespearean ""ye's"" and ""thees"" and ""thous""",0
3810,The NKJV is very readable for most folks,1
3811,But when I saw the Life Application version I was delighted to see all the very focused applications to real life,1
3812,The many other resources like a great concordance and maps were impressive but best of all I think were the summaries and highlights of each book before the actual text,0
3813,I want one for myself now,0
3814,A great gift for yourself or anyone,1
3815,What a great way to read the word of God and apply it to your daily living,1
3816,This Bible has been a great tool in my daily walk with God allowing me to draw closer and closer to him from the understanding of his word,1
3817,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend; I LOVE my Life Application Bible, and when she mentioned she could use a new Bible - this was my first and only thought",1
3818,Teresa,0
3819,"Highly recommend, it's kind of like having bible cliff notes",1
3820,The use of the more contemporary English makes this book a much easier read (like the thee and thou replaced with you and yours),0
3821,"The bible character profiles are really neat, they sum up the famous people in the bible in a very concise and interesting manner helping you to see them as real people, flaws and all",0
3822,"The world time-line is cool too, for perspective",0
3823,"But by far, the footnotes are the best part",1
3824,The explanations and application of the bible text are so easy to understand and are inspiring,1
3825,I actually like the thin pages,1
3826,"At over 2500 pages, the book is still very portable",1
3827,I think if the pages were thicker it might have to be printed in volumes,2
3828,"Notes, explanations, and applications are valuable",1
3829,The only problem is that the typestyle is too small,-1
3830,I can hardly see it without a magnifying glass,-1
3831,"Also, the paper qaulity is too thin!",-1
3832,This has been one of the best study tools that I own,1
3833,"This Bible not only has a short commentary, but it is loaded with history, profiles, and other information that is helpful for any Bible student",1
3834,I've read the Bible before but never have I understood its real meaning like I do now,1
3835,The footnotes below explaining each passage are extremely helpful and the messages are great for thought,1
3836,This is a great Bible,1
3837,"The footnotes, maps, biographies of Biblical personalities, etc",0
3838,really help in my understanding the Word of God,1
3839,Highly reccommended,1
3840,This Bible is the best I have found as a study Bible,1
3841,"It has so many things like outlines, maps and anything to make your study better and more understandable",1
3842,I order myself and my friend one,0
3843,She loves hers also,1
3844,I highly recommend this Bible,1
3845,I am loving this bible,1
3846,It's great for beginners or those wanting to brush up on their bible,1
3847,HIGHLY recommended,1
3848,I am very pleased with my purchase!,1
3849,I have searched and used many bible study aids and the Life Applicatiuon Study Bible is by far the best I have ever used,1
3850,I recommend it to anyone searching for a clearer understanding of God's Word,1
3851,I thought the print was too light and it was very difficult for me to read,-1
3852,"This study bible, along with all the Life Application Study Bible's, has great study aids and surprisingly good notes",1
3853,The most recommended translations available for this bible are the NKJV (this one) or NIV,0
3854,I don't care for the NLT as it seems to wander too far from literal for me,0
3855,I give the leather version of this bible 5 stars although it's a little heavy and thick,2
3856,"I have to give the HC only 5 because the color of the cover is horrid!

Overall, this is the BEST study bible for new Christians and I would give it to anyone",2
3857,Great bible to study with,1
3858,Gives good explanations of versus and has many other tools,1
3859,Definetely would reccommend!,1
3860,"This is a great study bible, in my favorite translation",1
3861,"(NKJV reads like the KJV, but without needing a special dictionary and a language class to read it!!) As far as content - there are tons of useful cross references, book overviews, special articles, and footnotes that are actually useful and worth reading!!  Physically, it is big and sturdy with real leather binding, and a beautiful gold coating on the outside of the pages",0
3862,"I have a 4 year bible degree, and have been to seminary, yet I still think this bible is my favorite!!",1
3863,"I love this Bible,it contains lots of extra info",1
3864,It is well made,1
3865,I would like a more in depth concordance though,1
3866,Great price,1
3867,sandy,0
3868,This Bible is great! The application commentary takes even the most abstruse and hard to comprehend verses and brings it out in a way that anyone can understand and apply to their own lives,1
3869,This Bible has helped me grow spiritually in every way,1
3870,"I would recommend it not only for readers who simply want to understand the stories of the Bible, but for those who want to benefit spiritually and truly understand God's Word and purpose",1
3871,I was really satisfied with my Life Application Study Bible,1
3872,It really breaks things down kinda in laymen's terms,1
3873,I would definitely recommend this bible to new readers and believers,1
3874,It has helped my insight on the bible quite a bit,1
3875,"Like previously stated in other reviews, pages are relatively thin so be careful",-1
3876,You cannot lose with this Bible,0
3877,"It offers a wealth of information, including footnotes, maps, concordance/dictionary, etc",0
3878,The study notes help me to understand and apply the scripture to my life,1
3879,How can you lose with the Bible? The Life Application is particularly nice because you can study as you go,0
3880,"The ""explanation"" for the passages are at the bottom of the page so you don't have to search elsewhere",1
3881,"First, let me say I like the NKJV",1
3882,The language used really displays some great meaning behind God's words,1
3883,I find it most useful when read with another translation like the NIV,1
3884,"The downside is the pages are exceedingly thin, as mentioned by another reviewer",-1
3885,I haven't ripped any yet and have tried to keep them unfolded,0
3886,The material included is extensive - at times I find the external material almost distracting,0
3887,The Life Application Study Bible in NKJV by Tyndale is the best Bible I own,1
3888,"The language is easier to read than standard King James version, offers helpful footnotes, maps, character references, bible in one year index, and book introductions",1
3889,"I highly recommend this product to anyone who belongs to a Bible Study group, or does daily Bible reading",1
3890,"This is a great study bible for any question and answer bible study, as it has the consensus opinion on meaning from many scholars, not just one person's opinion",1
3891,We purchased the study bible as a gift for our daughter to take with her to college,0
3892,She was very pleased with it especially the life application lessons,1
3893,Great bible,1
3894,"This Bible is a great! The cover is beautiful, there is no need to buy a Bible cover, It's very complete",1
3895,A wonderful Bible to be used as a tool for continuous spiritual and character growth,1
3896,"I definitely recommend it for anyone, and to those who are serious Bible students",1
3897,The Life Application Study Bible NKJV is an excellet Bible to read,1
3898,A grea tool for further your studies and walk with Christ,0
3899,What a good reference for the serious study,1
3900,I would highly recommend this version of the bible as it has a great deal of extra information as well as simply printing the text of the books,1
3901,"For example, as each notable person appears in the bible, a page is dedicated to them to talk about their pluses, thier minuses, their influences, etc",0
3902,"As well, the bible takes pains to ask you how you are applying the message of the text to your own life",0
3903,"Hence the title, the life application bible",0
3904,Get it!,0
3905,"Being somewhat new to the study of God's word, I have found this Bible to be very practical and a great source of information",1
3906,"Additionally, being a single column version versus the more common 2 column bibles makes it much easier to read",1
3907,"Great at explaining passages, giving historical significance and explaining the relevance in today's world",0
3908,I tried several other bible versions and finally settled on what I think is a thorough teaching bible,0
3909,This is a great bible,1
3910,There are explanations for most verses explaining what they mean and how they were applicable at the time they were written and how they can be applied to our lives today,0
3911,This was my very first bible,1
3912,"and I highly recommend it to anyone (first time reader's or ""0ld"" timers!)",1
3913,I have been giving Life Application Study Bibles away for about 8 years now,0
3914,The study notes are very good,1
3915,On the top half of each page you have the actual text of Scripture,0
3916,On the bottom half of each page you have the study notes,0
3917,The study notes are brief descriptions/interpretations of each individual verse,0
3918,"Of course not all verses are interpreted for us, largely due to space constraints",0
3919,All the major verses are covered,0
3920,What's really neat about this bible is that the study notes really help you to see how any particular verse of Scripture applies to you personally in your day to day life,0
3921,It breaks each verse down so that it's easy to understand,1
3922,Hence the name Life APPLICATION Study Bible,0
3923,Another neat thing about this bible is that this bible is really right about down the middle as far as Theology is concerned,0
3924,It's a bible that pretty much all denominations can agree with,1
3925,"Anyone from Petecostal Assemblies of God types, all the way to the other side of Southern Baptist Conservative types, or middle of the road Calvary Chapel types and everyone in between can enjoy and apprecaite",0
3926,"The reason this bible can be appreciated by such a wide variety of groups is not at all because it's wishy washy on Theology but, rather, it's simply because it majors on application",0
3927,That's what's so great about it,1
3928,Everyone from a brand new believer all the way to a well seasoned Bible Teacher or Pastor can greatly benefit from the study notes in this bible,0
3929,"If you are looking for a more Doctrinally or Theologically centered bible then I higly recomend John Macarthur's ""The Macarthurs Study Bible",0
3930,"Or if you're more the Pentecostal type more centered on the gifts of the Spirit, try The ""New Spirit Filled Bible"" by Jack Hayford",0
3931,"If you're more on the Calvanist, Reformed Theology type then try the ""Reformation Study Bible"" by R",0
3932,Sproul,0
3933,I believe Chuck Smith has also recently come out with his own Study Bible for you Calvary Chapel types,0
3934,"With all that said, I still highly recomend this Life Application Study Bible",1
3935,All of the above mentioned groups and many more will appreciate this Bible,1
3936,"I was looking for a Study Bible to assist me in taking my love and understanding of The Word to the next Level, and this Bible has definitely done that",0
3937,"I have been a believer for some time, but felt like I was not really getting the connection or insight that I could have with my Standard Bible; the commentary and other information is great for gaining insight! I really like the other features too like: a timeline showing the chronology of Biblical events compared to other world events; Each book has an introduction that describes the purpose of the book, the author, the historical setting, key verses, key people and summary to help you prepare for that book",2
3938,"There are notes breaking down just about every verse in each chapter to really help you get into the Word and then on each side, additional cross reference giving even more perspective",0
3939,"In the back you have an index to all the notes, Maps, and Concordance with Dictionary

The thing I did not like about this version is that the paper used for the pages is super thin and they fold and curl very easily",0
3940,Also many of the notes and Cosss ref's are in tiny print (Super tiny)  if you have poor vision you are going to have a hard time,0
3941,"The hard back weighs a bit more, but is well worth it with all the information you get",0
3942,I used the Essential Skills and Video Sessions 1-2 offered free from the website for classroom instruction,0
3943,The Administrative people in my class were able to process a major report for the Administrative Director after just this preliminary training,0
3944,"We are all impressed, ordered the Book and DVD, and are now continuing on with the full DVD and Book",1
3945,WOW! The Smart Method kicks into 2nd gear with great tips and options,1
3946,Everyone follows right along with the faster pace with a better understanding of Excel 2007,0
3947,These are all students with no or very limited Excel experience,0
3948,We are all looking forward to the Advanced Skills program by the Smart Method,1
3949,soothing British accented gentleman very purposefully walks you through Excel,1
3950,I highly recommend for those with no Excel experience at all,1
3951,I posted this on the Paperback review forum also since I bought that too,0
3952,"I worked through the entire video set ""Learn Excel 2010 Essential Skills with the Smart Method"" twice",0
3953,"I then took some online tests, they had questions on subjects that the videos had not covered",0
3954,"I thought they were just trying to sell their product by asking something arcane, but thought I would
see if the missing subjects were covered in Microsoft's Certification exam 77-882,and there they were",0
3955,"To see what else might be missing, without paying Microsoft $150 to take their test, I bought the paperback
version planning to scan the Table of Contents and the index and make them electronically searchable, they were
disappointingly to meager to allow me to find what is missing and add it in from other sources",-1
3956,"The real problem
is that everyone in the business seems to use different terms for things",0
3957,"This isn't about 2007, it is about 2010 DVD",0
3958,This is a great instuctional device for learning excell,1
3959,It is divided up into several dozen individual lessons in seven  categories,0
3960,Mike takes you through all kinds of substantive skills and also shows you how to make a spreadsheet look nice (which is important),0
3961,Each lesson is short enough (5-8 minutes generally) so that it doesn't get overwhelming,0
3962,Do as many as you wish and come back later,0
3963,"There is a workbook availabe and I highly recommend it, otherwise you'll be stopping every 30 seconds and taking notes",1
3964,"One thing I will say though, the claim is made that you can do it all in ""one intense day""",0
3965,Rubbish,-1
3966,It's great instruction but you are not doing it in a day,1
3967,The workbook I mentioned tracks the DVD very closely and it is almost 300 pages long,0
3968,I would suggest that for most with even a fairly busy life a month or more is more like it,0
3969,That's still pretty quick to learn a genuine job skill,1
3970,Great resource,1
3971,I can learn new things and review old things in the comfort of my home,0
3972,This software is really great,1
3973,"The DVD I purchased made my PC run very loudly, causing the fan to run very high and for a rather long period of time",1
3974,"Also, there is some kind of mechanical humming noise the DVD caused only when I used it",0
3975,I decided to not use it anymore since I wasn't sure if it was doing any damage to my new Dell laptop,0
3976,"Unfortunately, I'm not a satisfied customer",-1
3977,"I worked on excel sheets for about 4 years (Excel 97, on an older computer) I quit doing any Excel work for about
7 years, then got back into it",0
3978,I have Excel 2007 on a Windows 7 computer,0
3979,"There were a LOT of changes, so I ordered the Excel 2007 Essential Skills to try and brush up on the new changes",0
3980,"I thought I was pretty good with the basics of Excel,but after doing the lessons, I really learned quite a bit more",1
3981,The lessons couldn't be any clearer than they are on this DVD,0
3982,I just ordered the Expert Eddition of Excel also,0
3983,I highly recomend this to anyone,1
3984,I had to change my review because I did not realize that this was a DVD-ROM which plays a bit different,0
3985,i haven't had  chance to view the disc which is why there are 3 stars,0
3986,I will update when I get chance to look at the course,0
3987,I had to learn excel very quickly as we had lot of sales data coming from the different regions every day,1
3988,When it comes to numbers than there has to be a tool to analyse and take informed decisions based on the analysis,0
3989,I was initially able to help myself to learn the basics which are essentials and I was able to formulate the data in the desired pattern,0
3990,This really helped me in raising the red flags by looking at the numbers on my spreadsheet,1
3991,Saved my tons of hours that I consumed in optimizing the performance hence generated more revenue,0
3992,"Being in the midst of job searching, and finding that most jobs require experience in using Excel, I knew I had to learn this software quickly",1
3993,I had taken a class years ago but had never used the software in my job,0
3994,I was very pleased with this course on CD,1
3995,"The diction was precise and easy to understand, and the sessions were arranged so that even though each session had a higher degree of difficulty, each seemed just as interesting and the information was easy to learn and retain",1
3996,"I highly recommend this course to anyone needing to learn Excel, from the basic to the most complex skills",1
3997,"Although I haven't had the opportunity to finish all the lesson, I may consider getting the more advanced one as well",0
3998,The way it's explained is so simple and clear it's good for any level of learner,1
3999,"Not only the CDs were extremely helpful and easy to follow, but when I had a question and emailed Mr",1
4000,"Smart in UK, he actually replied to my email personally and showed me what I could do about the problem that I had",0
4001,This is an amazing and easy to use CD,1
4002,It makes this hard program so easy and easy to use,1
4003,Thank you,1
4004,The book is great and very explanatory,1
4005,The CD is difficult to open and follow but does have good information once you get it opened,2
4006,I would recommend the book,1
4007,A wonderly simple explanation about a difficult subject,1
4008,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Excel-2007-Essential-Skills-with-the-Smart-Method-DVD-ROM-Video-Course/dp/095545994X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn Excel 2007 Essential Skills with the Smart Method: DVD-ROM Video Course</a>",0
4009,This is better than a classroom experience!  The lessons are short and concise and the approach is sytematic and doesn't assume you know any basics,1
4010,The best part is you can repeat as many steps as you need to without holding back the whole class,1
4011,"Great for beginners but established users can benefit from knowledge they missed by ""winging it""",1
4012,"If you can rig up 2 monitors while viewing the lessons it helps, so you can view the fullscreen class and follow along in Excel on the other screen",0
4013,I would highly recommend this product,1
4014,"This series of lessons was great for an Excel novice, like myself",1
4015,"I was able to set up 2 computers and go through the lessons, able to back up and review parts of the exercises I had difficulty with",0
4016,I have continued to refer back to this disc when I encounter a problem with my daily spreadsheets,0
4017,His voice and presentation method were also good,1
4018,This is a fantastic video course!  Highly recommended,1
4019,"However, I purchased it from The Smart Method Ltd",0
4020,with fullfillment by Amazon,0
4021,The DVD arrived without cellophane wrapping and the entire readable surface was covered with scratches,0
4022,It was clearly not a new copy,0
4023,"Therefore, I would give the course five stars, but the quality of the product should receive 1 star",-1
4024,"I've just finished Lesson 1 so far, which taught me a few things that I didn't know after years of using Excel",0
4025,I like the instructor's teaching methods and being able to proceed at my own pace,1
4026,I've taken some full and half day sessions before that jam so much into a short period of time that I did't retain anything,0
4027,"Also I've not been able to fit any more extensive classes at local community college into my busy schedule, and they were more expensive than this",0
4028,I expect to learn many advanced skills in the subsequent lessons that will be a great help in my current job,1
4029,This is an amazing product!  Much more than I expected,1
4030,"I was familiar with Excel, but every lession taught me a shortcut!  I am learning graphing to use at work and it is FUN!  The course is laid out well and it is easy to find specific topics to review",0
4031,A very good product for the price!,1
4032,I truly agree with the other reviews of this product,0
4033,It was and still is very helpful,1
4034,"Through some of the shortcut keys and lessons on this video and the Excel Expert video I was able to do somethings in excel that co-workers, who are far more advanced in Excel than I am, were asking me how I did that",0
4035,I highly recommend getting the Essentials and the Expert DVDs,1
4036,It is definitely a great investment,1
4037,I had limited time to learn Excel and I was starting from a zero base of knowledge,0
4038,"Initially, I had downloaded the two free modules to determine if I could learn the information and found an exceptional learning experience with this tutorial",0
4039,"Hence, I purchased two, one for me and another to give as a gift",0
4040,I have finished the Smart coursework in time to meet an internet certification course that required skill in Excel,0
4041,"I would recommend this to anyone who would appreciate a slow, even-paced learning experience that excludes intense and large amounts of information being thrown at you",1
4042,"When you finish with The Smart Method, you will be knowledgeable and competent in the Microsoft Excel program",0
4043,Buy the book and DVD and learn from a great teacher,1
4044,"I admire the amount of thought for the student and love for the material that is evident in every lesson, and regret the time wasted trying to learn by other means",0
4045,"I purchased Excel 2007 DVD,and what a great product",1
4046,The product value is well worth the small amount for the training you get,1
4047,I plan on purchasing other products from The Smart Method,0
4048,"Just cannot say enough about this product, a must have if needing to learn excel fast and on your own",0
4049,This course is filled with great information,1
4050,I am using Excel more at work and looked around for a tutorial to help me get more familiar,0
4051,This class was more than I had hoped for,0
4052,I was able to put my new knowledge to work right away and have saved so much time with the tips I learned from Mike,0
4053,My husband works with Excel a lot and some of the tips I got from the course he did not know about,0
4054,This class is great for the novice or someone who uses excel frequently,1
4055,I also want to comment on Mike's teaching style,0
4056,I have taken other video classes and the teacher makes a huge difference in the experience,0
4057,Mike Smart does a great job! He is thorough and moves the class along at the perfect speed,1
4058,I can't wait for the Expert Skills video to be released,0
4059,I highly recommend this product!,1
4060,"I just finished watching the CD's ""EXCEL ESSENTIALS SKILL"" by mike smart and I found this teaching tool to be the best that I have ran across in years",1
4061,"If you need to learn Excel, don't go anywhere else, you won't need anything else, it's the best!

4062,"I have struggled through the frustrating learning ""on the fly"" process of every type of",0
4063,"Calc"" made, beginning with VisiCalc in the early 80's",0
4064,I have even taught others what I know,0
4065,"In the corporate world there never was time to attend classes or when there was time, the budget was taken by some other more important project",0
4066,"When there was a class, they were mediocre at best, taught by someone like me who too learned Excel ""on the fly",0
4067,"""
I initially purchased ""Excel 2007 Essential Skills - DVD version"" for my wife who was going to use Excel more extensively on a new job",0
4068,"I loaded it, and went through a couple of the Session 1 lessons and found out things I did not know that actually have made me understand how I could have used Excel easier and more productive",0
4069,"I am currently going thru the entire course in advance of my wife, but I have also ordered the book and the ""Expert Skill"" book and will most likely purchase the Expert DVD when it comes out too",0
4070,"I would highly recommend this lesson material to anyone, especially to managers who are looking for something to improve Excel Skills in their group",1
4071,The lessons average 4,0
4072,"5 - 5 minutes and if people did 2 - 3 every day, in a couple of months I am convinced their EXCEL skills and productivity would skyrocket",0
4073,Whether you're updating from an older version or learning Excel 2007 for the first time this is the best step by step learning tool you'll find,1
4074,Well worth the purchase price,1
4075,The training is broken down into labeled sessions with practices,0
4076,They are so easy to go back to for review,1
4077,I highly reccomend it,1
4078,For years I have fiddled about with Excel not really knowing too much about it and using it to do some simple calculations! Then I discovered it is a great database for contacts and made mail merging a whole lot easier,0
4079,After some time I became frustrated with how little I knew and decided to go on a course to increase my skill level,2
4080,In the process of searching on the net for a suitable course I came across this DVD course and I decided to buy it,0
4081,The result? The best money's worth imaginable,1
4082,The course is simply laid out in short concise lessons which are full of gems of information presented in a well thought out manner,1
4083,"Within one hour I was totally impressed with how informative and straight forward it was and, like a good book, it was hard to stop moving on to the next chapter",1
4084,I am pleased to say I now feel I am a competent Excel user and am looking forward to the more advanced book which I understand is soon to be published,1
4085,I am in the communication business and would be critical of any program that didn't do what it claims to do,0
4086,this product is as good as it gets and if you want to start the journey of mastering Excel 2007 then this is it,1
4087,I have also ordered the book to go with the DVD as I forsee it being an invaluable source of reference,0
4088,This is the best study guide I have found to teach Excel 2007,1
4089,You really need the audio and the book in combination,0
4090,I would stongly support you selecting this produce,1
4091,Teri Madak,0
4092,This DVD is a video presentation meant to compliment the author's book of the same title,0
4093,I was a complete novice to Excel and found the visual depictions to be really helpful,1
4094,Many of the very basic operations in Excel are done with the mouse,0
4095,"By it's very nature, this is a visual thing - Describing mouse actions in words is sort of counter-intuitive if you think about it",0
4096,I found it really helpful,1
4097,"Besides, you don't have to lug a big book around",0
4098,I ran Excel at the same time as the DVD so I could actually do what I was being shown,0
4099,That helped even more,1
4100,This is a great product,1
4101,I have used Excel for several years for many different things from pivot tables to advanced functions but I am learning quite a bit from the dvd,0
4102,This was originally purchased for my wife who has returned to school and needs to use Excel,1
4103,But I decided to run through it myself and am very glad I did,1
4104,I will have to get the advanced disc also,1
4105,Andrew,0
4106,Excellent video with many fantastic features,1
4107,I also have the book but have not used it half as much as I do the video,0
4108,"This DVD-Rom is great, upgrade of the CD-Rom sold previously",0
4109,"The videos od point locations and needling are great, but quite fast and short, but this is the only downside of the product",0
4110,"As all points have their own video, it is a helpful tool for both the beginners and advanced acupuncturists, for it shows the locations of ""difficult"" points (such as LU 7) as well as of the ""easy"" ones (such as LI 4)",0
4111,"I am very satisfied and so is everybody I know who has used this DVD-Rom, so I can higly recommend it",1
4112,"And, in comparison to the book, the search of the points is so much FASTER",1
4113,Its just what I have been looking for -- the whole textbook unabridged but maximized for interactive benefits by multimedia DVD-ROM,0
4114,"While I value many of the features of QPunctureII, a similar product, this one simultaneous excels in its study tools for students and in its value as a reference for more experienced practitioners",0
4115,Searching and cross referencing is in fact much more rapid than in a standard printed text,0
4116,"So after the first initial read, this is my favorite means to work with the material",1
4117,The printed text just can't implement all the features of the DVD,0
4118,"There are well designed sections detailing out the anatomy of critical landmarks such as the spinous processes, ribs, and other bony landmarks",0
4119,It provides good coverage on precautions to take when needling near organs,1
4120,"It contains both point-by-point information plus details of the major meridians, extraordinary points and chinese names",0
4121,Multi-media features include brief very good resolution videos of how to locate points on the human body plus chinese pronunciation of point names,0
4122,These are easily available at the touch of a link for every point,1
4123,"It is quite flexible as a study tool, allowing one to practice locating points by identifying first the general body region, and then the underlying key anatomical structures that simulate what one would feel under the skin as depicted in the next deeper level of the drawing",1
4124,"(I wish it allowed one more optional layer for clarifying location of nearby nerves, blood vessels, muscles/ligament groups and their names -- with some way to rehearse these as well)",0
4125,Practice tests can be configured as needed for studying particular meridians,0
4126,I especially like being able to contruct my own point combinations as desired for treating particular illnesses or regional pain problems,1
4127,"One can focus this process to rehearse Chinese names, too",0
4128,The testing features makes studying more meaningful -- helps one identify where additional work is needed and builds confidence,0
4129,"Given that every school seems to have a few of their own ""special"" pearls or point variations to learn -- it is extremely important to find a means to add in notes as well",1
4130,This program allows you to do so,0
4131,Deadman's Textbook/DVD multimedia program has already proven to be one of my favorite essential resources,0
4132,I expect it to be a companion for a long to come,0
4133,"Physicians acupuncturists will need to be mindful that the points are understandably determined by WHO international nomenclature, and there will be small variations in preferred locations for some individualized purposes",0
4134,"DRM Limitations

I previously agreed with another reviewer here about frustration regarding the DRM limitations",0
4135,These WERE quite annoying,-1
4136,"HOWEVER, the developers of the software have been extremely attentive to our concerns",0
4137,They have subsequently developed a patch which corrects this problem and allows the program to run disc-free,0
4138,"At first it glance, it seemed to be a bit cumbersome to install -- but actually was quite easy",2
4139,It does require that the full version of the software from the original disc be installed first -- which was not a problem for me as that is how I had been running it all along,0
4140,Then a brief online validation with a key the developers provide allows it to be unlocked,0
4141,If one needs to change to another computer there is a provision for uninstalling and then reinstalling somewhere else again,0
4142,This provides pretty much everything I had wished for,1
4143,I am extremely grateful that Tom Kennedy and his team at JCM have provided their willingness to listen which led to the creation of this solution until the next version of the DVD is available,1
4144,You can write to them for the patch at: jcmdvdsupport(at)gmail,0
4145,"com

This patch has continued to work through the first several trial on my computer",0
4146,"A few reboots, running other software and returning to MofA, as well as disconnecting from the internet after the initial registration/unlock was completed",0
4147,I am delighted to say that it is still working fine,1
4148,I now wholeheartedly recommend this DVD,1
4149,"First off, let me say that the content on this DVD-ROM is everything I'd hoped it would be",1
4150,Anyone familiar w/ Deadman's hardcopy text (which I also own) will know that the text is solid,0
4151,There are a wide variety of quizzes which are useful and well organized,1
4152,The videos for point location are great for to refresh your memory on the location of an obscure point you haven't used in several years,0
4153,If this was the whole story I would give this product 5/5 stars,1
4154,"Unfortunately, this otherwise useful tool is shackled by unreasonable DRM",-1
4155,"For those unfamiliar with the term, DRM is technology used to limit the ways in which one can use software that has already been purchased",0
4156,"In this case, the software requires that the DVD must ALWAYS be present in my computer in order to run the software",0
4157,This is incredibly inconvenient,-1
4158,The main reason I bought this software was for its portability,0
4159,This is hampered if I must carry a fragile DVD with me to use it,0
4160,"If I leave it in my DVD drive, then it makes extra noise when booting up and drains extra power from my laptop",0
4161,"Also, it means my DVD drive is occupied and not available for other disks",0
4162,"I would prefer to be able to keep the DVD safely in my office or at home, but this is not possible",1
4163,Hopefully nothing will happen to the disk,0
4164,My recommendation is to make do with the hardcopy text if you have it already,1
4165,The added benefits from the DVD don't compensate for the inconvenience of the DRM,0
4166,"Also, if you need to use it in a quite place (such as a library or classroom) make sure your DVD drive is quiet, as mine (superdrive in a macbook pro) makes too much noise for these applications",0
4167,I'm disapointed,-1
4168,I bought this but it won't work outside US,-1
4169,It's absurd that it is not specified on the product,-1
4170,Shame on Marvel,-1
4171,This DVD collects all FF issues including annuals,0
4172,"The company has scanned in all the pages (including ads, Bullpen page, letter pages, and back cover) from actual issues",0
4173,"A few of the pages are scanned in slightly crooked, but this could also be the printing on the originals",0
4174,"I thought it might be difficult reading the comics on a computer screen, but after a few pages I liked turning a page with the push of a button",0
4175,"If you have a bright monitor or laptop, the colors should look nice",0
4176,Make sure that you upgrade to Acrobat Reader 6 (included on the disk) so that the Marvel watermarks don't show on your screen,0
4177,If you try to print a page the watermarks will (I believe) appear,0
4178,"Overall, a wonderful addition for those who have the original issues (as I do) but can't read them because of their value, for those who don't want to buy a bunch of the Masterworks titles, for those who want to see the comics with the original colors and printing quality, and for those who want to read all the issues in color",0
4179,"The cost of the total collection may seem high, but think about buying over 550 comics",-1
4180,"That's less than a dime an issue--more than I paid years ago!

As Marvel does more of these, they may ""crash"" the back issue market",0
4181,People who have the comics may decide to buy these DVDs and sell their back issues,0
4182,Highly recommended,1
4183,"I had been using Dave's online budget tools which are much, much nicer",1
4184,I'm not able to save months at a time like I could on his program,-1
4185,"You can only do one month at a time, there's no way to electronically duplicate the file and save multiple months",0
4186,It serves its purpose but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it over other budget programs,2
4187,"I can draw up a budget without his charts  - so, most likely can you, if you are smart enough to think you need this DVD",1
4188,"So don't waste your money, or your TIME! Just go to his website or watch his program a couple of times",-1
4189,"EVEN Dave, if pressed would or should tell you this is a waste",-1
4190,The snowball idea which shows you your total payment if you make minimums is nifty - but about the only good thing about this DVD,0
4191,"Smart money maker for you, Dave",1
4192,Shame on you!,-1
4193,I love the snowball calculator that calculates how long it will take to pay off a debt given your payment amount and interest rates,1
4194,It really helps to see how much even a small amount extra added to the principal payment goes a long way towards paying it off early and saving lots in interest fees,0
4195,The budgeting worksheets are also useful,1
4196,Very user friendly,1
4197,This review is for the v5,0
4198,3 release of this software,0
4199,I've really gotten into Dave Ramsey's way of thinking about money in the past few months,0
4200,The message and the messenger are great,1
4201,"This software package however, is not worth even the $10 I paid for it",0
4202,The calculators are extremely simple,1
4203,You can find better ones at almost any decent bank or financial site,0
4204,"The worksheets might of some use, but you can do as well with a pad of graph paper and a ruler",0
4205,I have used Dave Ramsey's Gazelle budgeting online for several years,0
4206,I thought this product would save me the expense of paying for it every year,0
4207,I loaded it onto my computer and there were several issues,0
4208,It said it wasn't compatible etc etc,0
4209,I finally was able to open the software and it would work for about 5 minutes and then shut down,0
4210,It did save my information each time but the process was annoying,-1
4211,I thought it was my computer so I downloaded it onto my husband's and then my daughter's,0
4212,3 different computers same issue with each,0
4213,LOVE IT!,1
4214,It didn't work because the seller did a really great job and refunding my money,1
4215,"I really wanted the software but it keep asking for a  license number and it was really cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for",1
4216,I listen to Dave's radio show when I happen to be in the car at the time it is being aired,0
4217,Mostly good advice,1
4218,"Pretty much: if the shoe fits, wear it",1
4219,"I, personally, believe that there is a happy medium to having some debt/leverage if done conservatively and with a specific reason -- but that's a different discussion",0
4220,"I've been looking for a personal financial software package for years that would easily download my transactions from my bank and give me: (1) a good history of where my money went, AND (2) a cash-flow projection based on future expenditures and expected future cash income (NO ONE, particularly or including Quicken, really knows how to do this where it is truly useful) and Dave's very simple app doesn't either",0
4221,"For Money 101, the app is probably fine -- but it lacks more than it delivers",0
4222,"item was listed as new but when I tried to install it it told me that it was like a book, 2 different people cant read it at the same time",0
4223,so obviously it had already been used and its tracking was still out there,0
4224,Didnt complain cuz it was only 6 bucks but the next one I will buy straight from the site,0
4225,"it was really easy to get started and it helps to get organized and start keeping up with savings, checking, etc",1
4226,Excellent Program! It was very easy to install,1
4227,I am learning a lot by using this program for my Personal Finances,0
4228,I recommend it to all my friends,1
4229,"I have the Financial Peace University kit, you can get all these forms on his website for FREE! The only thing that this has is the Debt calculator but if you can do simple math you don't really need it",0
4230,I am glad I didn't pay full price but I should have listened to other reviewers and not bought this,0
4231,This product provided all the necessary forms to get us moving in the right direction financially,0
4232,It keeps everything organized,1
4233,We especially like the debt snowball calculator,0
4234,Exactly what I needed- easy to use and looks to be a great tool!  Dave tells it the way it is!,0
4235,This software met my expectations and was exactly what I was seeking,1
4236,It installed easily and functions as expected,1
4237,I would recommend this product,1
4238,"The DVD includes installation files for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh",0
4239,I installed it on Ubuntu 13,0
4240,04 and it was fairly straightforward,0
4241,"The license allows this to be installed on two machines so I was able to install it on both of my computers, one with Linux and the other with Windows",0
4242,"Excellent! What a fantastic, versatile software",1
4243,I love it and it was easy to learn! I would highly recommend it to anyone,1
4244,"There is nothing like this out there! For me, it's always a struggle to figure out what next steps to take in my spiritual growth",0
4245,"What book to read? What class to take? What message to listen to? This helped me figure out that my main issue is ""inaction in conflict"" and then gave me resources to address it in a way that fits my learning style",0
4246,So Cool!,1
4247,Before I start my review I want to say two things,0
4248,"First off, I only give 5 star reviews to things that change my life",1
4249,"Second, although I was raised Catholic, I am more interested in Christianity from the academic point of view",0
4250,Glo is by far the most amazing Christian tool I have ever used,1
4251,"The artwork, maps, videos, etc that are linked to biblical scriptures brings the bible to life like nothing I have ever seen",0
4252,Bible study groups will love the topical sections which is an encyclopedia of relevant scriptures,0
4253,Students will love how easy it is to navigate and learn from the bible,1
4254,Anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity will find Glo to be a valuable tool,0
4255,I truly wish this was out during my Catholic School days,0
4256,"Despite having a 5 start review, there are some things I would love to see added",1
4257,A timeline that followed Christianity through the present time,0
4258,"A Christian Denomination option for an upgrade, or an add on (as an academic I would love to have links to different writings and additional texts of various denominations)",0
4259,Inclusion of scriptures that did not make the NIV Bible,0
4260,"Overall I feel that by using the Glo software, you will see Christianity in a whole new light",0
4261,Every person that I have shown this program to has gone out and bought it,0
4262,That says something about the quality of this product,1
4263,(FYI I have a Mac and it worked with out any problems),0
4264,"Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed",0
4265,"After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go",0
4266,The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first,0
4267,"If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple",1
4268,Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version,0
4269,"Things glo has improved upon:

++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program",0
4270,"There are ""lenses"" that ""distribute content over a zoomable interface,"" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials",0
4271,All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user,0
4273,"++  The user can check out the ""contributors and sources"" on the company website",0
4274,I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web,0
4275,"++  There is a ""Quick Install"" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel",0
4278,"The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users",2
4279,Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech,0
4280,"I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch",0
4281,"With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting",0
4282,"If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review",0
4283,"In this ""revolutionary new Bible"" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies",0
4284,"GLO features:

++  450+ Virtual Tours
  These are 360-degree tours of ""modern-day and re-created"" ancient biblical locations",0
4286,"5 Hours of HD Videos
  You'll be able to enjoy the ""In His Shoes"" HD interactive documentary",0
4287,"++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos
  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph",0
4288,"++  7,500+ Articles
  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan

Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria",0
4289,There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings,0
4290,"I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article",0
4291,"++  650+ Works of Art

++  Integration with the best web content

++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program

++  Concise, compact organization through five ""lenses""

++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study

LENSES:

BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily",1
4292,"TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation

MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and ""reading plans",0
4293,"""

MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more",0
4294,"ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger ""picture"" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest",0
4295,"TOPICAL:  Here you can ""quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts",0
4296,"""

DVD-ROM drive

This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software",0
4301,If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor,0
4302,"The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people",0
4303,"If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously",1
4304,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GLO-Premium-Multi-device/dp/0982697813/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GLO Premium: Multi-device</a>&nbsp;is a program that provides Bible content and integrates it with tools, maps, images, videos and more",0
4305,"From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features",0
4306,"As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented",0
4307,"And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value",1
4308,Many have reported installation problems,-1
4309,"For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7",0
4310,The program required that I install Microsoft,0
4311,"NET framework 4 first, and the related updates",0
4312,"But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed",0
4313,"The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas",0
4314,The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac,0
4315,"You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me",0
4316,"But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs",0
4317,That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally,0
4318,This product is advertised to work for multiple devices,0
4319,"While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs",0
4320,I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices,0
4321,"The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images",1
4322,"This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible",1
4323,"CONCLUSION

This is a very good program",1
4324,"Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort",1
4325,Enjoy,1
4326,Glo is the perfect tool for anyone who wants just a little bit more out of their Bible study,1
4327,"It's great for any user: Students, parents, pastors, and small groups",0
4328,There are so many components It would make my review too long to go through them all,0
4329,Think of it as an annotated Bible,0
4330,"There are videos, articles, photos, artwork, and notes to go with every verse, every category, every topic",0
4331,"The Bible is also sorted into topics like Faith, Relationships, God, etc",0
4332,and you can search for specific verses or articles within those topics,0
4333,There is a journal application where you can use a very simple word processor to make notes,0
4334,"The ""Sessions"" tool is really cool",1
4335,You can multi-task and jump from one thing to another without losing your spot,0
4336,"think of it as ""tabbed browsing"" on the internet, only it's on a computer program",0
4337,I love using Glo,1
4338,It's really cool and easy to use,1
4339,"I don't have an Iphone or an Ipad or anything like that, but Glo does sync with those products",0
4340,I loved this product and it has many features that I love,1
4341,Unfortunately I have moved to an Android device and this OS isn't supported as of yet,-1
4342,There is no date or any updates on when they will support Android,0
4343,"If you use an iPad, Apple Computer or PC then you will absolutely love this product",1
4344,The reason for the 3 stars is lack of Android support,-1
4345,This was everything we were told it would be! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a true study bible,1
4346,I have had this program for a couple of years now and it is great,1
4347,I bought it around the time that it first came out and I have had not problems running this program,0
4348,Those who have had issues running it maybe need to upgrade to a more modern computer with enough memory and fast enough CPU,0
4349,But this program has been instrumental in my bible study journey,1
4350,I am still waiting for the Android app to be released,0
4351,Still learning on how to use it but so far I'm very pleased,1
4352,It would be better for some of us when going to the Bible it would be a hole name above the books!  only used it for 3 mouths,0
4353,Please see below my request to glo and their response,0
4354,"Hello glo!

Recently I purchased a used copy of Premium glo from Amazon",0
4355,com,0
4356,When I tried to register the software I received the following message,0
4357,"The serial number that you entered has already been registered I understand the message and since I possess the original CDs and the original packaging, including the serial number, I am asking you to un-register the previous owner and allow me to register as the current owner",0
4358,Thank you in advance for your consideration in this matter,1
4359,"Peace!

Sincerely,

Mick Rogers

Dear mrogers007,

Thank you for contacting Support for your 'Powered by Glo' application",1
4360,We apologize for the delay in responding,0
4361,We are experiencing a higher than usual ticket volume,0
4362,Unfortunately this is not possible and I would suggest you return the product to the owner so you can get your money back,-1
4363,Amazon is pretty good about these things,1
4364,"Sincerely,

Phillip
'Powered by Glo' Apps Support",0
4365,App is a fantastic idea if it worked,1
4366,Constantly locks up and have to delete and reinstall,0
4367,Support does not respond to any request,0
4368,"Is not worth the frustration, time or money",-1
4369,Warning do not buy!,-1
4370,I have now had this software for about 3 years,0
4371,"With the latest Windows packages and computers I am finding the graphics are not up to speed and often blurry, and the program is now crashing a whole lot",0
4372,"In fact, the program has ceased to work, was difficult to uninstall and has never reinstalled again",-1
4373,But then I downloaded the free LITE VERSION which you can get on their site and can be used on iPad as well,0
4374,"And everything works!  Perfectly and with better graphics!

In short, don't buy this because it will become nothing more than a boat anchor",2
4375,Just get the free version and enjoy!!,1
4376,"Let's start of by mentioning that the creator of Glo and Ilumina is one person, so you won't hurt his feelings if you choose one or the other",0
4377,"I was expecting Glo to be one step above Ilumina, and in a  sense it is, but another sense it is not",0
4378,"Glo is better than Ilumina in the sense that you can go to a chapter and verse in quick easy steps, and you can open multiple sessions of the Bible (and other lenses for that matter) at the same time",1
4379,"Also, Glo lets you select a passage in the Bible and drop it to all of the lenses to see if anything in the passage is connected to the atlas, media, etc",0
4380,"What is lacking in Glo that is in Ilumina are the HD animations, guided tours, and the Bible Encyclopedia",-1
4381,"Glo does have an encyclopedia based from Zondervan's Pictorial Encyclopedia, but it is only for some and not all articles whereas Ilumina has the entire Encyclopedia available",0
4382,"In summary, for those who have Ilumina and not sure if Glo is worth it, for $35 Glo can be a perfect companion of Ilumina",1
4383,"There are so many great ""extras"" in this Bible, like HD videos, maps, pictures, etc",1
4384,it really makes studying the Bible more interesting to me,1
4385,"Also, a feature of Glo is that you can drill down and do topical studies",0
4386,I love this feature,1
4387,"As a society, we need to study the Bible",1
4388,"As Believers, obviously this is even more so",0
4389,The Glo bible is a great way to dig in to the word and get a more thorough understanding,1
4390,I was so impressed with this that I just ordered one as a gift for a good friend of mine,1
4391,The program is easy to use and works well on my computer,1
4392,I would recommend using it if you like to use maps and an easy to look up scriptures program,1
4393,This was a very difficult install,-1
4394,I ordered the discs and struggled with installing them,0
4395,I have Windows 7 with 6 gigs of RAM and I would think this appropriate,1
4396,"When I loaded disc 1 of 3, it wouldn't let me load the 2nd and 3rd discs",0
4397,I tried everything I could think of,0
4398,"Finally, I canned the discs, and downloaded Glo light and then downloaded the full version from the internet",0
4399,"Same price, but at least I was able to get it downloaded",0
4400,"I love the Glo Bible, but was VERY disappointed with the discs",1
4401,"Okay, now that it is installed, it is great",1
4402,I also installed it on my Macbook and IPad,0
4403,It was very easy to transfer,1
4404,All I had to do was get the Glo app on the IPod and type my username and password and it was instantly installed,0
4405,Same for the Macbook,0
4406,I had originally installed it on the PC laptop,0
4407,No problem with the PC vs Mac systems,0
4408,It will allow 5 different installs,0
4409,2 to go :-)  I have spent a few hours with it and can't be more excited and happy with the Glo Bible,0
4410,It really brings to life the Bible,1
4411,"I have always wanted to go to the Holy Land, and with the Glo Bible, I can get as close as possible without actually being there",0
4412,"It has really broadened my understanding of the events, timeline, and locations depicted in the Bible",0
4413,It has actually brought my Bible to life,0
4414,I am not a Biblical scholar whatsoever not have I ever played one on TV,0
4415,I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible,1
4416,"GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others",0
4417,There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background,0
4418,For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used,0
4419,"The words, however, come through and are the same",0
4420,"The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference",0
4421,That's a good thing and GLO does it well,1
4422,I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait,0
4423,There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons,0
4424,I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording,0
4425,"Additionally, GLO sends its audience updates for contents and historical facts",0
4426,This is the best thing for a new bible reader,1
4427,I got three pages into Genesis and about shed tears on the pages because there were words I didn't know that were not explained in the study portion of the text in a regular bible,0
4428,I decided to try this because I know on normal electronic books you can highlight and look up words,0
4429,My experience is changed completely!  I love all the features-my favorite is the personalized reading plans,1
4430,I also enjoy the small video clips of lectures and sermons,1
4431,This is definitely worth the money for a truly wonderful bible experience,1
4432,This is a Bible software like I never seen before,1
4433,It is so full of very useful material that I don't even know where to start so I will keep it simple,1
4434,"I love that it has the ESV and NIV among other translations with study notes, articles, videos, illustrations, maps, commentaries",1
4435,Everything you could ever use to prepare a sermon or a Bible study,0
4436,Even if you are not a Pastor you will still benefit from this software,0
4437,it can be used in up to 3 computers as well as your iPhone and/or iPad,0
4438,WARNING: The description says that you need 18 GB of free disk space to fully install this software,0
4439,You may also want to consider your RAM memory because in order to have two or three things going on at the same time you will need all the memory you can get,0
4440,"So I recommend that the computer that you use for GLO Premium has at least: 320 GB memory, 4GB RAM memory,i5 or i7 processor and a decent video/sound card as well as a decent screen",0
4441,The reason for this personal recommendation is to ensure you get the most out of this amazing product,0
4442,I purchased the GLO Premium,0
4443,This is what tablets were invented for,0
4444,I cannot imagine every buying another bible again,0
4445,"The different versions are all right at my fingertips!  Beyond that though, the bible is easy to navigate",1
4446,The commentaries are excellent and the video just adds to the value,0
4447,It is all a great package and one I have recommended to my friends and recommend to you,1
4448,Glo has so much information that it's more like an encylopedia than just a Bible,1
4449,"I loved the lenses approach to seeing different timelines, maps, reading plans, etc",1
4450,Made it very easy to navigate and learn,1
4451,It really helps you put all the Bible into the context it was written in to give you clear insight and is great for doing studies,1
4452,I do with though that it had more options for looking up words in the original greek/hebrew but other than that this is a great study tool and I can see so many people benifiting from it,0
4453,GLO is a visually stunning bible program with so much to offer,1
4454,"Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming",0
4455,You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks,0
4456,There's so much to GLO,1
4457,I'm still discovering stuff about it,0
4458,"GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff",0
4459,Reading the bible on GLO is a joy,1
4460,The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen,0
4461,Makes it easy to read,1
4462,In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes,0
4463,You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion,0
4464,"(Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading",0
4465,"If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further",0
4466,GLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package,1
4467,"Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible",0
4468,Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to,0
4469,The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons,0
4470,This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through,0
4471,"Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well",1
4472,Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power,0
4473,GLO is graphically intensive,1
4474,"Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting",0
4475,"However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities",0
4476,Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created,0
4477,The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information,0
4478,I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit,0
4479,"I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it",0
4480,I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet,0
4481,I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning,-1
4482,That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one,0
4483,GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away,0
4484,It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from,1
4485,It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you,0
4486,The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration,-1
4487,I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around,0
4488,this was an expensive device and i am very dissatisfied with its performance,-1
4489,"every time i try  to copy verses it says GLO has to shut down because of a critical error!!
dennis f thornes",-1
4490,I am in absolute AWE at how much information glo premium has regarding the Bible,1
4491,"In the few weeks that I've owned thie program, I have learned more about the Bible, than I think I've learned in years",0
4492,"There are video documentaries, detailed maps, Bible reading plans, timelines, links to links to videos on Youtube (with really great speakers), links to web articles, a journal for your own personal notes",0
4493,"this is the BEST guide if you want to learn about the rich history, learn and discuss about the many mysteries the Bible contains, and most importantly on building a strong relationship with God",1
4494,"The layout of the program is very thoughtly done - whenever you click on a link, it ""opens up a new window"" within the program, thus breaking your clicks into ""sessions""",0
4495,You can revisit a session if you get distracted and click something else,0
4496,"The Bible reading plans are completely customizable to what you want to read, how  often each week you want to read, and even how many minutes each day you want to spend reading it",0
4497,"When installing the program, you don't have to download all the information onto your computer - you can use just one CD and have all the information that glo provides streamed directly from the internet to your computer (thus greatly freeing up memory on your computer - there is 18GB of info on all the disks!)",0
4498,"According to glo, there's always more content being added to the already vast amount of information included",0
4499,This is a amazing program - I've already suggested to the Pastor at our church to get it - it's a great reference tool!  Highly recommended!,1
4500,"I will say, as other reviewers have, that I am not a truly religious person",0
4501,"But I did find this GLO software to be absolutely fascinating, and have spent many hours click click clicking my way through maps and videos, references and cross references, details, photos, and more",0
4502,I truly enjoyed the viewable art work and the virtual tours,1
4503,It's just amazing to me that so much content can be contained in one small box,1
4504,"If you have friends who are history buffs, readers of the Bible, or just a thirst for learning new things, this would make an excellent gift",1
4505,"I know that I should read the Bible a lot more than I do, but sometimes it just doesnt pull you in",0
4506,"Well, with this device, it makes it so much fun!  It really brings the Bible to life",1
4507,I could not recommend it more highly,0
4508,"I purchased this for my husband for father's day, he loves it! It has a lot of really neat stuff in it",1
4509,The photos are all I've seen and are very detailed and well put together,1
4510,He's very happy with it,1
4511,"GLO Premium is a fantastic piece of software for everyone from the casual bible studyist to dedicated students, and can also be a valuable resource for teachers and preachers",1
4512,"The program is stable, well thought out, easy to navigate and is packed full of features, making it an incredible value",0
4513,"GLO Premium installed quickly and easily on my homebrew Vista x64 Intel Core i7 system, full install taking less than 15 minutes from start to finish, using all 3 discs provided",1
4514,"GLO has proven to provide a new way to study the bible in the digital age, giving a streamlined and efficient approach to learning and exploring the bible that would take hours longer manually cross-referencing multiple material via reference books",0
4515,Highly recommended!,1
4516,I've not had nearly enough to look at this all the way through,0
4517,It would probably take years,0
4518,But thus far I am very impressed,1
4519,The content is rich and informative,1
4520,"It's fun to hunt down all the ""rabbit trails"" looking for new information",0
4521,Very well done!,1
4522,"It took a little over an hour for me to do a full media install of  Glo Premium on my ASUS, Windows 7, laptop",0
4523,Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those,0
4524,I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now,0
4525,I think the loading time,0
4526,"switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc",0
4527,sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program,1
4528,"If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device",0
4529,I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church,0
4530,"By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing",1
4531,"There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more",0
4532,I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around,0
4533,"As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map",0
4534,"Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map",0
4535,"Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info",0
4536,Clicking on the map brought up even more information,0
4537,"By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming",1
4538,"Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e",0
4539,"com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu",0
4540,Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too,0
4541,Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too,0
4542,"If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page",0
4543,"This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more",0
4544,"To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced",0
4545,"A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV",0
4546,I'd like to see NLT added,1
4547,I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side,1
4548,I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history,0
4549,"And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included",0
4550,"In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming",1
4551,"Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium",0
4552,"UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop",0
4553,Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app,0
4554,I'm loving this on the IPod,1
4555,"I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented",1
4556,"An attempt is made to segregate it, but if you watch any of the company's videos, you'll see there's an overwhelming amount of data",0
4557,"It's all good mind, you and it's easy to get lost looking at pictures, seeing videos, watching trails",1
4558,"It's a superb product, but I can easily see where some people might get overwhelmed",1
4559,"Still, if you dive into it, you're gonna experience the Bible in a completely new way",0
4560,"Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion",0
4561,"In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this",0
4562,It's kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist,0
4563,One issue though,0
4564,Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive,0
4565,"There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1",0
4566,That's not too bad,0
4567,"But if you want to do the ""full"" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install",0
4568,"I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time",0
4569,"Once it was all installed, the C:\ProgramData\Glo directory on my Windows 7 machine had a total of 10",0
4570,"8Gb of data, and a whopping 351,892 files!  Wow",1
4571,Glo failed to meet my expectations,-1
4572,"Warning here: unless you have high speed internet service or 18 GIGABYTES of hard drive space available, don't buy this product",-1
4573,"I have an external hard drive with plenty of free space, but glo refused - three times - to load the program data files to that location",0
4574,"I have high speed internet service, so I was able to sample all of the ""navigational lenses",0
4575,""" The timeline lense is so generic that I could imagine no use for it",0
4576,(I expected something as useful as the timelines I buy from Rose Publishing,0
4577,) The media lense had interesting photos and videos,0
4578,"Again, interesting, but not too useful",2
4579,"I anticipated enjoying the video book ""In His Steps",0
4580,""" Unfortunately, the glo server was unable to download it to me",-1
4581,I use BibleSoft as my digital Bible study library,0
4582,I expected glo to complement my BibleSoft program because it has such a depth of media-rich material,0
4583,That's not happening yet,-1
4584,I think glo is still in the beta test stage,0
4585,"This program has it all - Several versions of Bible text, art, video tours, maps and customizable reading plans",0
4586,The program is very intuitive and easy to manipulate,1
4587,Topics are grouped in different ways to make research easy,1
4588,My only complaint is that I was unable to sync the program between my computer and my ipod,-1
4589,I can only get the free version of the app to work on my ipod,0
4590,This means I can't access my customized reading program on the ipod and I'm more likely to read from my ipod while cozied up in a chair or in bed than I am from my desk pc,0
4591,"Still, I can't knock off too many points for this because the problem is just as likely to lie with the user (me!) as with the product",0
4592,So I'll stick with 4 Stars,0
4593,"The abundance of information makes this a good program for the serious scholar, pastor,Sunday School teacher or bible study leader",0
4594,I think the general consumer who is looking for simple devotional material may be overwhelmed,0
4595,I love this program,1
4596,My husband is a pastor and I wanted to get this for him to use for sermon preparation,0
4597,"The first of the three discs is easy to use and we have both found lots of cool things to use, like maps and timelines",1
4598,He alone has used the second discs and he has assured me that the content is great on them as well,0
4599,I did have a small problem loading the disc the first time,0
4600,"My Mac spit the disc back out, but the next time I put it in it took it just fine and installed perfectly",0
4601,"It was most likely user error, not an error on the disc",0
4602,"I just don't know what all I can say to tell you that this is a rich, content packed program that you will use a lot and that you will recommend to others",0
4603,I received a copy of the program for review purposes,0
4604,No additional compensation has been received and I was not required to write a positive review,0
4605,"It will take many weeks and even months to explore all the options and possibilities in Glo, but my initial response is this: Impressive! I've spent two weeks exploring the content every day, and I've barely scratched the surface",0
4606,"The Amazon product description and other reviewers have detailed Glo's content, so instead of repeating the description, I'll share my observations so far",0
4607,"Overall evaluation--Despite some typos & grammatical errors, this is an impressive body of information",0
4608,"Not suited to objective research (see below) and useful only as a supplemental resource in academic settings, but excellent for personal use and/or evangelism support",0
4609,Homeschool families in particular will love it,1
4610,"BIBLE--Included are the traditional KJV and the popular NIV 1984, NIV 2010, ESV, MSG, versions accessible to laypersons and acceptable to conservative Bible readers",0
4611,It's easy to toggle between versions for comparison,1
4612,Study guide links to relevant excerpts from the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible,0
4613,"""YouVersion"" allows readers to add their own commentary to the study notes for each chapter, providing a sense of community and sharing",0
4614,TIMELINE--Significant dates from creation (which is identified as happening in 3950 B,0
4615,", with Adam and Eve placed at 2500 B",0
4616,) to the death of John on Patmos in approximately 100 A,0
4617,ATLAS--Maps arranged chronologically; just click on the period,0
4618,"Captions tie key events to places, with some editorial comments",0
4619,"Sources would also have been welcome; for example, the map offers two possible locations for the Garden of Eden according to ""two main theories"" but does not identify or credit those theories",0
4620,"TOPICAL--Index by ""cluster"" branching out from four main terms: God, The Bible, Faith, and Relationships",0
4621,"Each of these categories has a cluster of possible topics; for example, ""Faith"" leads to the headings Man, Sin, Spiritual Beings, The Church, End Times, Creation, Kingdom of God, Eternity, Evil, and Spiritual Warfare",0
4622,"Under ""Relationships"" --> ""With Myself"" --> ""Addictions"" --> ""Internet"" two of the three articles deal with sexual issues (pornography, cyberaffairs); the third linked article (on internet gambling) is available only to Christianity Today subscribers",0
4623,"No mention is made of other internet addictions such as online gaming, shopping, social media, etc",0
4624,So far I've found only links to conservative websites such as Focus on the Family and Lifeway,0
4625,(Christianity Today is included but Christian Century is not),0
4626,"While the Glo content is presented as objective reference material, the selection of articles will be satisfactory to Christians who are pro-life or creationist or believe that homosexuality is a sin",0
4627,MEDIA--Virtual tours are particularly fascinating to explore--click for increasingly detailed insets nested one inside another,0
4628,"Choices are somewhat arbitrary; detail of the Mount of Olives identifies northeastern view, slopes, summit, Gethsemane, and Church of All Nations, but not the magnificent Church of Mary Magdalene clearly shown directly behind Gethsemane",0
4629,"MY GLO--Lots of neat personalization options, such as a tool allowing reader to create drag-and-drop presentations",0
4630,"I particularly like the Bible Reading Plan, which let me set a goal and tailor a personal plan to reach it",1
4631,"NOTE-- This review is the Mac version, which requires OS 10",0
4632,8 or higher,0
4633,I have OS 10,0
4634,"7 with nearly 400 GB available, which should have been plenty",0
4635,"Even with high-speed cable, installation took forever, and the installer crashed twice in process",0
4636,"After each crash I had to start over from scratch, which was irritating",-1
4637,"A lot of new features in 2014a, especially in image processing toolbox",0
4638,I like how fast you can use the thresholder app to do image processing work,1
4639,Only just received it but still able to do basic equations and plots right from the start,0
4640,"Looking forward to more sophisticated operations as I go through the book that I bought with it, ""Essential Matlab for Scientists and Engineers"", got the book for $9",0
4641,00 as its an old edition but it is still plenty useful to this old retiree!,0
4642,Yes this is a great thing,1
4643,"Also checkout UDEMY classes at sourceforge, they are great deal!",1
4644,Thanks,1
4645,thanks,1
4646,I have to remember down load it on pch,1
4647,I ducks on image or any apple computer,0
4648,Great numerical software,1
4649,It is a leader among the engineering people,0
4650,OK as expected,0
4651,"Shipped quickly, made the process very simple",1
4652,Just downloaded it once entering information into my MathWorks account,0
4653,What I was a bit baffled by was the fact that it came in a package instead of through email,0
4654,It came in a little package with instructions and a sticker with the code,0
4655,However it's most likely for security reasons,1
4656,It works great the little I have used it in the last two days since I revived it,0
4657,It's nice especially as a student researcher,1
4658,"It is important to note that this is not an actual CD, just a booklet that gives you the installation instructions and activation code",0
4659,The instructions however seem to be a bit outdated for the website,0
4660,You should first create a profile/account on the mathworks website,0
4661,"It will ask you when you are creating the profile if you have a code to enter (this is optional at this point, but I did it and it ultimately worked fine) which will allow the product to activate after you download it",0
4662,"In the instructions it says to download the MATLAB and Sumulink suite, but what it does not tell you however is to do that without paying for it again (there is a store on the website where you can pay the $99 to download it), you have to click the Support link at the bottom of the page",0
4663,"After you do that, there is a button to download the software",0
4664,At the start of the download you will have to enter your school information,0
4665,During the process of creating an account you have to enter an email address which it will then require you to verify via a link sent to that email,0
4666,"I just used my school email address, but it did not seem like you had to use an email ending in",0
4667,"edu at that point, I just did to make it easier",1
4668,"When you start the download you will be required to tell it where you go to school, and then it will register and then the process of downloading and installing (which takes probably 20-25 min depending on your computer speed) and registering/activating your license",0
4669,After the process was complete I was able to open and use the product without any problems or any other verification of my status as a student,0
4670,Anyone who is enrolled in any kind of engineering program with likely have to use MATLAB in at least a couple classes,0
4671,"I am in an online/distance program and my school went from giving us relatively easy access to MATLAB through citrix, to having to remote into the computer lab computers on campus to use it, which made it insufferably slow on my newer laptop, and impossible to access on my older desktop",0
4672,"So to make things easier I just purchased this, and have been very pleased with that decision so far",1
4673,"After a somewhat confusing download/license generation effort (NOT the seller's fault), I downloaded and activated my new matlab",0
4674,"I tried it out
using my longest and most demanding script and was delighted how quickly it processed the data! It's all I had hoped for!",0
4675,"I don't like the lack of physical media that is now the norm, but the apps work as expected",-1
4676,If someone is buying this to learn circuit analysis and/or design I would encourage you to look at other options,0
4677,"MATLAB and Simulink are exceedingly powerful, but the power comes with a steep learning curve",1
4678,"You might want to try open source Octave, before buying this",0
4679,"i am satisfied with this software , it was very helpful for me",1
4680,Thanks Amazon,1
4681,I am still trying to learn it,0
4682,For the time being I am very happy with it,1
4683,"Matlab, once a powerful and revolutionary tool, has become redundant in modern academia",0
4684,In 1981 MathWorks successfully bridged the gap between academic and industrial computing by providing an interface for inexperienced user to quickly and easily perform complex calculations,0
4685,"In 2015, the lack of versatility no longer warrants the hefty $500 price tag; the product still performs its intended mathematical functions, but the scope of the program is much smaller than several free programming alternatives",0
4686,"Modern technical computing has evolved to be more user-friendly, and Matlabs refusal to innovate has taken away its niche in the marketplace",0
4687,Great product!,1
4688,What you are buying is a code to install online and not a disc,0
4689,Working well with what I need it for,1
4690,Exactly as described,1
4691,I did think I was going to get a CD with it but I may have missed something in the posting,0
4692,"Otherwise, excellent product and it comes with all the add-ons a student needs",1
4693,I would highly recommend it,1
4694,great software,1
4695,It works but I am having a hard time understanding what I am supposed to be doing,2
4696,Also it took me days to download successfully because it kept saying something was unavailable and so I was unable to download it,0
4697,"I love this software, maybe I'm just nerdy, but I can see several potential uses and benefits of using this program",1
4698,Came on time and worked perfectly on my mac,1
4699,Does this version works with Mac XO 10,0
4700,"Great starter text, if you are doing any scientific lab work, this is a great tool",1
4701,amazing,1
4702,Great tool for engineers,1
4703,Easy to learn and lots of capability,1
4704,It has helped my studies of engineering principles,1
4705,"Oh, and it was required for the classes",0
4706,Thansk!,1
4707,"I bought this here because I was hoping for an actual CD, I was mailed a card with an activation number instead",0
4708,I bought this at all so I could learn to program visual stimuli with psychtoolbox at home,0
4709,"I haven't gotten to that yet because:
% CAUTION: Psychtoolbox *will not work* yet with 64 bit versions of Matlab
% or Octave on Microsoft Windows",0
4710,"It will work with 64 bit Matlab and
% Octave on Linux and 64-Bit Matlab on OSX, with 64-Bit Octave support on
% OSX planned",0
4711,"So, I really have nothing to say about how the program works because I haven't gotten it working yet",0
4712,"Yes, I tried to put some linux on my backup computer, but it turns out its intel video card is poorly unsupported and psychtoolbox refused to run with a chuggy video card",0
4713,I will try again later once I get over the fact that I paid for this because octave doesn't work well with windows and it looks like I can't use this with windows either,0
4714,"You can do whatever you can think of with this buddy, control your arduino, make mechanical simulations ( you need to make the 3d drawing in whatever software you like but save it as a STL format) I am still figuring out the structural analysis but I am sure it can too",0
4715,Make mathematical solutions,0
4716,"Its an extremely flexible program, but if you are in a hurry ( trying to make your thesis as fast as humanly possible and look smart) I recommend the Labview, saddly the student version can only be bought in SparkFun WITH and Arduino if you live outside the US in a country where there is no distribution of labview student",1
4717,"After using Octave for a long while, it is refreshing to use Matlab",0
4718,A nice clean interface and Simulink is awesome,1
4719,Very good,1
4720,"Very straight forward software that was easy to install, and easy step by step to load all your information which will condense into a basic will",1
4721,"Also provides a sleuth of other documents that includes power of attorney, who will take care of the kids if you and your partner are no longer around, health",0
4722,You can easily update at anytime as your circumstances change over time,1
4723,Neat as it will print off into a document,1
4724,"I was disappointed that there was an extra $90 for the revocable trust, which you complete online",-1
4725,I rather pay etxra to have all that information held on my own system,0
4726,"At the end of the day, this software provides everything you need at a very cheap price than employing a lawyer",0
4727,"Obviosuly if your life is a little complicated then you may still need to reference to a lawyer, but great if all you have is a few basic assets!",1
4728,"After I received my software, I looked through the package, downloaded the encyclopedia, took a look at the software & started a will",0
4729,"So far, so good",1
4730,In process of starting the will it suggested that if I was intending on making a living trust that I do the trust first,0
4731,Fine,1
4732,"When I did the install originally it placed a ""Free Nolo Online Trust"" icon on my desktop, so I clicked that, then had to register, etc",0
4733,"But I kept getting a screen where it wanted to charge me the retail price for the ""free trust""",0
4734,"I tried a variety of things to rectify the problem, including sending an email to them",0
4735,"I didn't get a response, so I used their online chat",0
4736,They had to enter my free registration directly from their end to get it to work,0
4737,"So if you have the same problem, that's what you'll have to do",0
4738,It works fine now,1
4739,"Included with the software is a little book ""Your Little Legal Companion""",0
4740,I wasn't too impressed with it,-1
4741,It seemed more like an attempt at humor rather than a serious guide to help you through legal problems,0
4742,"I haven't gotten far enough into the process to rate it any further, but I'll adjust my rating as things develop",0
4743,"Ok, it's been a long time since I bought this program, but I've made my will & can now give a worthwhile review",0
4744,The part where you actually make the will is surprisingly easy and straightforward,1
4745,"But, and this is not any fault of the publisher, you need to expect to do an enormous amount of background reading on each topic, topics which are available for you at each step of the process in the software",0
4746,"Actually, that is perfectly reasonable since you don't have an attorney sitting across a table from you guiding you and understanding your background",0
4747,You need to educate yourself on the pertinent laws and ramifications of the choices available to you before you make your will,0
4748,"So, yes, the amount of reading to complete the will correctly is imposing but well worth the effort",0
4749,I feel well-educated now and want to let everyone know that I heartily endorse this product,0
4750,"Like it predessesor, WillMaker Plus is a excellent tool for everyday will making for the average family",0
4751,"However if you have complicated issues with real estate holding, business mixed with property and equipment issues I would suggest the assistance of a professional",0
4752,This product has a myriad of legal forms and simple step by step directions,0
4753,For the price this is a good product to have around just for the legal info and forms it contains,1
4754,The interface and question and answer procedure it has seems to be quite extensive,0
4755,I would buy this product,1
4756,I don't know anything about writing a will,0
4757,But doing it the traditional way can't be any easier than using WillMaker,0
4758,I wasn't looking for anything fancy or complicated,0
4759,"I just wanted a simple, bare-bones, straightforward will that divides up my possessions among a handful of people",0
4760,"It took me less than 30 minutes to install the software (Windows 7, install went smoothly) and create a basic will that met my needs",0
4761,And of course if things ever change I can easily modify the will,1
4762,There are a lot of more options that I didn't try yet because I don't need them,0
4763,"But should the need arise, it's nice to know those additional features are there",0
4764,"My sister has cancer, my niece moved int with two kids from another state, I manage my fathers accounts, boy we needed some of these basic forms",0
4765,"No its not lawyer advice, but its much better than nothing",0
4766,"My mother died last year and this would have helped with issues she thought! she had resolved, buyt it and use it",0
4767,I have Willmaker Plus 2010 and also got the 2011 update,0
4768,"From what I can tell, the documents are just as thorough and comprehensive as those produced by a lawyer",0
4769,I hired a lawyer to produce most of these documents for me and the lawyer produced documents are very similar to those produced by Willmaker,0
4770,The difference is in knowing what documents are needed and what strategy needs to be followed in setting up your estate plan,0
4771,This is where the lawyer earns his (or her) fees,0
4772,The lawyer can evaluate your situation and advise you on the best legal approach for you,1
4773,"Willmaker provides guidance in estate planning, but it still takes quite a bit of study to figure out all of the traps that you can fall into",0
4774,"For a relatively simple estate with few complications, Willmaker Plus 2011 is excellent",1
4775,"The more complications and holdings you have, the more you might want to consider hiring a lawyer",0
4776,Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011 is almost TOO easy to use,1
4777,My Gammy and I have hated each other ever since I borrowed her car years ago and lost it in a street race where I had to bet the car itself,0
4778,1981 Lincoln Town Cars can't drift at all! I could have died! I never forgave Gammy for writing me out of her will as a stupid revenge ploy,0
4779,"Fortunately, after a brief stint in jail I was able to trade her jewelery to my buddy Carlos for a copy of Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011! I cleverly waited for her dementia to rob her of her ability to speak so that she couldn't rat me out to the rest of my family (who have also never respected my street racing talents)",0
4780,Then I went to work,0
4781,"WillMaker Plus has an excellent tutorial that helped me create exactly the type of will that I believe Gammy would have wanted! I know that she would have wanted to repay me for her past selfishness with her entire estate!

But that's not all",0
4782,"Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011 is SO easy to use, my old demented Gammy was able to use it to CHANGE this will to make her cat, Mr",0
4783,"Bojangles, the sole beneficiary of her estate! That's right, a 92 year old woman with dementia using a computer program successfully! Have you ever heard of something so ridiculous? I think not! WillMaker Plus 2011 is THAT easy! It took me two months but I was finally able to convince her that Mr",0
4784,Bojangles was the secret leader of the evil elves that have been trying to poison her food,0
4785,The estate is mine once again and Mr,0
4786,Bojangles is history! Maybe Mr,0
4787,"Bojangles should have picked up a copy of WillMaker too, if you catch my drift",0
4788,Hahaha,0
4789,"Thank you, Quicken WillMaker 2011!",1
4790,Yes you can install on a Mac,0
4791,You need a Virtual Machine with Windows,0
4792,"I have Mac OS X Snow Leopard
HERE'S HOW:
1",0
4793,Install Oracle VM Virtual Box FREE [,0
4794,] <-I used Oracle but you can try any other VM software,0
4795,You need a licensed copy of Windows OS to install on the VM,0
4796,I installed Windows XP Professional,0
4797,<-Check which Windows platform will support WillMaker,0
4798,Get the updates for the Windows OS,0
4799,Install WillMaker <-Note: Nolo Press does not support installation on a VM,0
4800,Remember the VM is like a separate/new machine and you will have to configure your printer,1
4801,I had a licensed copy of Adobe Acrobat for Windows so I can print/save to pdf,0
4802,If you want folder share from your Host (Mac) and mouse integration check out [,0
4803,"]
-->For me , this is a way better solution than the web-based applications Nolo offers for Mac users!
*This review is for Mac install only",0
4804,Very satisfied,1
4805,"Very thorough, but extremely difficult to navigate",2
4806,Not as user friendly as it should be,-1
4807,HELPS GET THINGS IN ORDER,0
4808,Horrible piece of software that is extremely difficult to navigate and rather a strange template for a will,-1
4809,Total waste of money all around,-1
4810,they were a quick shipper and the product was as described,-1
4811,the price was far and I would recommend them to my friends,1
4812,"It's probably a great item, but I didn't read the small print that said that Louisiana is not included in their drop down list",2
4813,amazingly Office Depot also carries this product in our state - Really- if you can't use it,0
4814,"Anyway, it was useless to me",0
4815,READ the SMALL print,0
4816,I just couldn't get to grips with this software,0
4817,"It's not bad, but I just thought that in this case, it would be easier just to eat the cost and pay an attorney to do this for you",0
4818,"Not for me, but might be for you",0
4819,"I have a friend who needs to create a will, a living will, and powers of attorney",0
4820,He does not like to deal with lawyers or accountants,0
4821,"I have not yet approached him about these things, but I plan to do so soon",0
4822,"So, ease of use is important",1
4823,I believe it will fill the needs that he has,0
4824,It got here fast,0
4825,It was easy to use and got everything in order that I needed to do,1
4826,Would recommend it to everyone,1
4827,I had a simple need - to make a will,0
4828,"As my wife and I have children, it was important for us to name guardians, set into writing they got our assets and ensure the executor of our estate was the person we wanted",0
4829,This program let us do that in literally a matter of minutes,0
4830,"Now I have a will, the documents to send to the interested parties and our minds can be set at ease",0
4831,I was completely blown away how easy this process was,1
4832,"Additionally, this program contains the ability to generate a ton of other forms that might be of interest such as a living will or healthcare directive",0
4833,If I had one nitpick it's that I can't verify the strength of the legal documents and explanations while available could have been a touch easier to follow,0
4834,"In summary, I had a simple need and I was able to fulfill that need with what seemed like the least amount of pain possible",0
4835,In a nutshell Quicken WillMaker Plus is a great easy way to make a basic will,1
4836,You can make multiple wills (one for you and your spouse for example),0
4837,"Doing so is easy and straightforward, all that you have to do is answer the questions as they are asked, print get some witnesses and your good to go (pardon the pun)",0
4838,"Seriously though, the 2011 version was great I would recommend this product and assume the 2013 version will be just as good",0
4839,"I have a hard time reviewing computer programs, I mean - what is there to say?  As long as it loads and does what is needed, there isn't much to complain about",0
4840,"Unfortunately when I had to update my computer from Vista to Windows 8, I was not able to transfer this program, so that's a problem",-1
4841,"Needs to allow access to Windows 8, or provide a patch or update so it can be used on the newer platforms",0
4842,"Why do I give this program five stars, yet urge the reader to be careful?
Because having a will valid for probate is not enough",0
4843,"You can painlessly create a will and estate documents valid in any state (except Louisiana) by using Willmaker Plus, but unless you're absolutely sure that your will will not be contested, you should be working with a lawyer who is a specialist in trusts and estates",0
4844,S/he will make efforts to ensure your wishes are carried out even if someone who is disappointed with your bequests takes their disappointment to court,0
4845,So I would recommend using this program to create a valid will and avoid some legal fees IF you are sure your survivors will be on board,1
4846,"I thought this software sounded like a real good idea, but after trying it out, I decided I wasn't really comfortable using software for a will",1
4847,"My life is complicated, and I really felt more comfortable using a lawyer",0
4848,"I am giving this one 3 stars as a ""neutral"" rating",0
4849,You may feel comfortable using this software,0
4850,I did not,0
4851,This program does what I bought it for,0
4852,It asks you some questions and then will create a legal will that can be printed,0
4853,It also tells you how to sign it and witness it to be legal,0
4854,I already had a earlier version so this one was not needed,0
4855,I ordered it because I have another Quicken package Lawyer that no longer works and I can not open the Quicken files,0
4856,QFL,0
4857,I still cannot open them and Quicken was no help!,0
4858,This product is great if you have been putting off making a will,1
4859,"I don't think it's a substitute for legal advice, but it should work for uncomplicated wills and is far better than not doing a will at all",0
4860,It is supposed to tailor itself for your state requirements,0
4861,"Once you decide what your wishes are, it is easy to use and asks a series of questions in a manner similar to tax preparation software",0
4862,"It does not allow some terms that are commonly used in my state, such as ""per stirpes,"" but it handles that in a different way, letting you name who is to inherit if a beneficiary should predecease you",0
4863,"You can name a guardian for your children, and it even lets you name and provide for a caretaker for your pets",0
4864,"It gives directions on how to get the will properly witnessed, which must be done correctly",0
4865,It also includes things like advance directives for healthcare,0
4866,"If you can't bring yourself (or don't need) to see an attorney, use this software to make sure your wishes are followed",0
4867,"Otherwise, state law will dictate what will happen if you should die",0
4868,pretty simple plans really so for a basic will with out going to a lawyer,0
4869,it's a starting point but how legal?,0
4870,It would be so much easier just to talk to a lawyer to get all this done,1
4871,"The software is klunky and not so easy to use, with a lot of legal jargon",-1
4872,Maybe newer versions are better designed and more user friendly,0
4873,Nothing Quick about this Quicken Willmaker Plus 2011 software,0
4874,It was simple and brought online great for Wills and also has other documents for medical directives and other forms,0
4875,"When reviewing software, nothing ruins the experience more quickly than a failed installation",0
4876,"I encountered two installation problems with WillMaker: 1) Clicking the 'Register your product' button takes me to Nolo's page for buying the 2013 edition of WillMaker, and instructions for registering the 2011 product are nowhere to be seen; 2) Clicking the 'Web Update' button that offers to download updates for the 2011 version installs files that break the program's ability to launch",0
4877,"Granted, I am reviewing and installing the 2011 edition of WillMaker, and the current version is for 2013",0
4878,"That being said, the online notification assured me that 2011 online updates would be available to me through the end of 2012 (and the installer does indeed install something, albeit a bad something)",0
4879,"I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and hit the same failure twice",0
4880,"I uninstalled again, then reinstalled without requesting the online update",0
4881,This worked,0
4882,"Still, I view this to be a huge black eye for the product",0
4883,Additional salt was rubbed into my wound when I followed the link for a free online living trust that is advertised on the box,0
4884,I instead received a notification that the offer had expired (despite the fact that no expiration date is listed anywhere on the packaging),0
4885,"WillMaker then offered to help me create a bunch of documents, and estate planning documents like a will are only one category of what is offered",0
4886,"Being offered documents beyond the expected estate planning documents is not a negative, but was somewhat confusing given the program's name",0
4887,"I guess this is what puts the ""plus"" into WillMaker Plus",0
4888,"Perusing the box, I see that these extra documents are indeed part of the promised functionality, therefore, no marks off for my (brief) confusion here",0
4889,"I then jumped into the meat of what I assume most customers want from WillMaker, i",0
4890,", the wizard that helps one to create a will",0
4891,"You are presented with a checklist outline that explains what the process will be, and then you are walked through a series of dialogs which query you for your personal information and desires for your will",0
4892,Each page has a right pane with additional information for each question that you need to answer,0
4893,"Everything seemed straightforward here, so high marks for the data entry aspect of WillMaker",0
4894,"After answering all the questions, you are presented with an on-screen draft of your will which you may subsequently print",0
4895,The on-screen instructions explain that you need to sign it with two witnesses to make it legally binding,0
4896,I have to accept on faith that the legal quality of this will is sufficient to cause my estate wishes to be executed according to my desires,0
4897,It seems to me that the prudent consumer would pay an estate lawyer to review the job done by WillMaker,0
4898,I also suspect that there are free online boilerplates that would allow me to craft a similar document,0
4899,Another area of uncertainty for me is the trade offs between a living trust and a will,0
4900,"Granted, WillMaker is designed to create a will, not a trust",0
4901,"But if we ignore the semantic implications of the product name, what the consumer really wants from this product are the documents that control the disposition of one's property after death",0
4902,"To not devote even one yes/no question to ""do you perhaps need a trust rather than a will?"" seems like a serious flaw to me",0
4903,"In summary, I found WillMaker Plus 2011 to be underwhelming despite receiving it for free via Amazon Vine",0
4904,The installation problems are totally unacceptable,-1
4905,And the final output document leaves me feeling like I need to visit an estate lawyer to review the result,0
4906,"If the price of WillMaker plus the cost of reviewing a WillMaker-generated set of documents is less than having the estate lawyer create the same set of documents from scratch, then this product pays for itself",0
4907,But that's a pretty big if,0
4908,"My husband & I used this software in late 2010- early 2011 to update our wills, a long overdue necessity",0
4909,"Quicken Willmaker Plus is simple to use, fairly easy for the non-legal experienced",0
4910,"We live in California so we used this to make our own ""holographic"" wills without needing a lawyer",0
4911,The book included was helpful and answered the more common questions,0
4912,"I would definitely recommend however, checking the laws in your state before proceeding",1
4913,"We will probably purchase this software again around 2015 to update again, unless circumstances seem to indicate that we need to update sooner",0
4914,I purchased the 2011 Quicken Willmaker Plus 2011 in order to create a Revocable Living Trust,0
4915,The Willmaker comes with a Free Nolo's Online Living Trust shortcut that facilitates creating the Living Trust,0
4916,"When I accessed that shortcut, I was informed that it was outdated, and I would need to purchase the 2012 edition of Quicken Willmaker",0
4917,"Thus, I got nothing for my money",0
4918,"I was trying to save money by not having to get an attorney to create the Revocable Living Trust, but I ended up wasting money instead",0
4919,The product shipped quickly and was received in good condition,1
4920,The software provides very comprehensive documents,0
4921,"What I've found so far is this isn't a ""quick"" format and requires answers to all questions whether applicable to one's needs or desires which then makes extremely lengthly documents",0
4922,"For me, WillMaker served better as a guide than as a replacement for an attorney",0
4923,I admit it,0
4924,I drug my feet on completing my will,0
4925,I didn't realize just how much paperwork is needed to die,0
4926,"The software provided me an excellent step-by-step guidance of the process; it was more like a ""For Dummies"" kit than a complete tool itself",0
4927,The templates aren't forgiving for creative wishes but the time spent practicing with WillMaker no doubt will reduce the time spent with an attorney,0
4928,"For that reason alone, I recommend the software",1
4929,"Whether you use WillMaker alone or use it as a springboard to develop your will with an attorney, the software will educate you and save you money",0
4930,Rating: Four stars,0
4931,"I bought this, because my old WillMaker (2008) would no longer work",0
4932,It wouldn't even let me open the software to view the documents I had previously created,0
4933,"It told me that it was out of date, and that I needed to get a new version",0
4934,I was stunned,0
4935,"I know you shouldn't make Wills using old software, as the laws change",0
4936,But it should at least let me open my documents and view them,0
4937,"To make things worse, the new version would not read my old 2008 version file",0
4938,"So I lost everything, and had to start from scratch",0
4939,It does make it easy to create a will and create some other documents,0
4940,"But the fact that the old version just stopped working, and the new version wouldn't play friendly with the old version, just makes me angry",0
4941,I don't think I'll use WillMaker again,-1
4942,A will is a must even if you don't have much of an estate,1
4943,"If you die without a will your estate must go to probate and that will just be added delays,expense and headaches for your family",0
4944,This software makes it easy to prepare a will and give you a chance to let your final wishes be known out as well as sparing your family the hassles of probate,1
4945,Its the best gift you can give your loved ones,1
4946,Super fast install in Windows 7,1
4947,"Includes a small book called, ""Legal Companion""",0
4948,It just gives you a few pages on each topic for a total of 200 pages,0
4949,Too many topics to list here but a good reference first read when getting into any situation,0
4950,"I wasn't able to download ""Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law"" so I chose the 2012 option instead, ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use""",-1
4951,The 2012 version is out now so I would advise getting that one instead,0
4952,"&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Willmaker-Plus-2012-Edition-Book-Software-Kit/dp/1413316352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Willmaker Plus 2012 Edition: Book & Software Kit</a>

Instead of me going through the specifics that are already so well covered in other reviews, I chose to share with you additional material on QWP2011 instead",0
4953,As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here,0
4954,I don't say that to detract the value of the program,0
4955,For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents,0
4956,"I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them",0
4957,This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities,0
4958,For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself,0
4959,"Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love",0
4960,"Everyone, except those with complicated estates, should have this program",0
4961,"It has everything in it you will need, from power of attorney, to living will, to making out an actual will",0
4962,And it is so easy to use,1
4963,"I just finished my will and other estate and personal documents:  Will, declaration of trust, advanced directives, durable power of attorney (finances), general durable power of attorney (attorney-in-fact), and medical durable power of attorney",0
4964,I used WillMaker and found it to be as advertised,0
4965,"However, by the time I had prepared all documents, enough questions had arisen that I decided to contact a local attorney for help with answers",0
4966,"In numerous places of the WillMaker instructions, the user is informed that contacting an attorney might be necessary and is a good idea if needed",0
4967,"I learned a number of very important estate-protecting things from the attorney that I could not have learned in WillMaker (tips from an insider, one might say)",0
4968,"I also learned that several of the state-specific forms provided by WillMaker were quite far from ideal - not incorrect, just prepared and formatted in ways that could cause problems and delays for my estate executor and beneficiaries",0
4969,"After my second meeting with the attorney, I had the opinion that I could have saved myself one hell of a lot of work had I gone to him in the first place",0
4970,I paid the attorney for his good services - including all that horrible witness signing and notarization business for which I have no stomach,0
4971,The cost for for having him do it all would have been under $300,0
4972,"To me, given all the time I spent doing the initial work on WillMaker, the necessary change work I did on WillMaker after consulting the attorney, and all the yuck I would have gone through on my own getting notarization & witnessing of documents, the better alternative would have been to have the attorney do it all in the first place",0
4973,"By the way, I found that once I committed to the WillMaker approach, making document changes recommended by the attorney was not such a simple thing (formatting issues using the WillMaker's ready-made templates)",0
4974,"So I think that WillMaker is a good product, but before you decide to go the WillMaker route, ask yourself if it is likely that you will want or need to consult with an attorney anyway (if only to ensure that everything is exactly right - not just legally right - for your executor and beneficiaries) and if you have the paper-management skills and patience to complete the project on your own",0
4975,"My estate is neither the most simple, nor the most complex; just a middle-class, retired guy's situation",0
4976,Best!,1
4977,All I can say is that everything went as expected,0
4978,"Obviously, I found the product online, ordered it, and received it on time in excellent condition",0
4979,I'm very happy with my purchase,1
4980,I thank all concerned for their professionalism,1
4981,This is a great deal,1
4982,It was very easy to follow the instructions and did everything I expected and more,1
4983,I was not sure if software was the way to go,0
4984,I use the Tax software and like it and have used it for years,0
4985,I was very happy with what I paid for,1
4986,It did what it said it would do,0
4987,"The GUI isn't the best, but I didn't buy the product for that",-1
4988,"All I neeeded to do was answer some easy questions, and the help was great",1
4989,This is a whole lot cheaper then a lawer,0
4990,"I wanted some quick and easy software to create a legal will for myself (you know, just in case, always a good idea 'they' say), and this software does just that!  In about the space of 45 minutes, I had created a great customized will for myself, including leaving multiple specific bequests: the software is super easy, with templates already installed, and you run through the prompts and answer the questions to produce a will: great product, would definitely recommend!",1
4991,Nolo Press has done it again,0
4992,WillMaker Premium is indeed the premier will making product on the market,0
4993,Easy to install on the computer,1
4994,Quickly walks you through the steps to prepare a will appropriate for your State of residence,0
4995,In a matter of minutes you have a great will,1
4996,I bought this to be able to save money by doing my own will but was very disappointed to find that you had to pay more money to complete a will,2
4997,"This package contains so much, including what everyone should have:  1",0
4998,Will; 2,0
4999,Health Care Directive to Physicians (Living Will and Power of Attorney); 3,0
5000,Durable Power of Attorney for Finances; 4,0
5001,"Final Arrangements (Funeral Wishes); and, most importantly, 5",0
5002,Information for Caregivers and Survivors,0
5003,"If you have ever had a loved one become incapacitated through illness or injury, you know what a mess it can be to make sure their bills are paid (especially health insurance!), their business keeps running, what food their pets eat, etc",0
5004,"Item #5 maps all of that out for your loved ones, including account passwords for e-mail, etc",0
5005,"When my business associate, who is not married and has no children, was in a 10-day coma last year, this sure would have been handy to have!
There are many more docs in the program, including children's care, etc",0
5006,The best thing of all is that all of these documents are customized to the state in which you reside,1
5007,"The documents are straightforward, without layers of legal language",0
5008,"I'm not an attorney, but they seem sound to me and I trust Quicken's reputation",0
5009,Amazon has the best deal on the Web for this product,1
5010,"Easy to use, step by step process that is easy to follow",1
5011,Great product for producing a simple will,1
5012,Very happy with this product,1
5013,"The user interface for this software could use an update, but all in all it is easy to use and seemingly works as intended",2
5014,"Plus, I was pleasently surprised at how many documents other than a will it had templates for",1
5015,I've used several of them already,0
5016,"One complaint I'd have though is that when you print documents, you get so many unnecessary pages",0
5017,"When creating a will for my wife and one for me, we must have wasted at least 10 pieces of paper",0
5018,"Not a huge deal, but not environmentally friendly either!",-1
5019,It took me 30 minutes to complete a basic will,0
5020,Here's what you do: put together the list of people who will be involved with your will and add their addesses to the list,0
5021,That's the hard part,0
5022,"Next, read and follow the directions",0
5023,I hope this review was helpful,1
5024,Please add your vote,0
5025,"This software was exactly what I was looking for - worked out great!  Great suggestions, information, and I was very comfortable using it - good state information and direction for anything I wanted to do",0
5026,I completed a Power of Attorney; An Estate Plan and Will for my husband and myself,0
5027,Highly recommend the Quicken WillMaker,1
5028,Easy to use and effective< good product,1
5029,All your personal information remains with your computer and in your safe,0
5030,If you want to change something just pull it back up,0
5031,I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person),0
5032,Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3,0
5033,"Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface",1
5034,WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product,1
5035,"Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's",0
5036,The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions,0
5037,"Seriously, that's it",0
5038,You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing,0
5039,"I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my ""final intentions"" are",0
5040,"I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say ""give it all to so-and-so""",0
5041,I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin,0
5042,"I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to",0
5043,But no,0
5044,None of the above,0
5045,Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value,0
5046,I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product,0
5047,"It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the ""list price"" of 70",0
5048,There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus,0
5049,"The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver",0
5050,"By the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the ""free updates"" are only good through the end of December",0
5051,I found this software easy to pick up on,1
5052,"After the Schiavo case, I think it's important for people to have a living will set up, and that's another great feature that this walked me through",1
5053,"Going through this really made me think of a lot of areas that I had just never thought of before, and I feel better now having put directives in place",0
5054,I love that this even gave me information on how to put documentation together to assign a caretaker for my cats! This was another really useful and great Quicken product,1
5055,"I've found most software these days that I've used in the past to be really user-friendly and well set up, and this was very easy to move around with and become comfortable with",1
5056,"I like how I was not only walked through the process of creating an estate plan, but that it was also easy to figure out what was important for my individual situation",1
5057,Have used an earlier version of this WillMaker that was on my mother's computer and bought this one so I could have my own copy and update my will,0
5058,"Good product to create a will, etc",1
5059,Amazon price is about half of retail so it's a very good deal,1
5060,Ireceived the download to my computer but not to a disk since then the computer crashed so now i don't have the download to re-install please advise,0
5061,I really think the nolo willmaker is very accurate & dependable looking foward to the new release this coming august,1
5062,Another great deal through Amazon,1
5063,com and a great product which is easy to use and fits well with our State regulations,1
5064,This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used,0
5065,I liked the 2009 version,1
5066,"Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move",-1
5067,"(Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*",0
5068,"If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i",0
5070,"31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws",0
5071,")

This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free",0
5072,This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year,0
5073,"While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again",0
5074,"Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products",0
5075,"Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations",1
5076,"How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city",0
5077,It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker,0
5078,"What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself",0
5079,This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher,1
5080,I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate,0
5081,"For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc",0
5082,You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills,1
5083,"Another thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before",-1
5084,"The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains",0
5085,"It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version",0
5086,"(And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in",0
5087,)  I find this practice unethical,0
5088,Most likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use,1
5089,"I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review",2
5090,"There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers",0
5091,"But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community",0
5092,"I wrote a review when I first used the 2011 version, and then erased it",0
5093,"I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will",0
5094,"I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print",-1
5095,"Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper",-1
5096,"I also find the ""help"" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside",0
5097,"It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent",0
5098,"So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess",0
5099,"Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better",0
5100,"I find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself",0
5101,"The big example here is Quicken, I have an old 2000 version and it's really just a register for you to input finances, not an organizing or accounting tool at all",0
5102,"Again, I'm referring to the 2000 version",0
5103,"It's not enough to just enter all your transactions over the years, you have to summarize things, but it's not that good at doing that",0
5104,I have to say that this software is great to save yourself a lot of legal fees,1
5105,"From what I gathered from using it, I would have to say that it doesn't leave out anything in terms of how you want your things distributed",0
5106,"It answers many questions on a lot of different subjects, like elderly parents, children that reside in different countries, right down to how to direct your items to people other then direct family members",0
5107,"I used this to create a will for myself, and am glad I did",1
5108,"I may in the future decide to go to a professional if I so desire, but with using this, I don't really feel the need",0
5109,My brother in law saw me using this software and wanted to know if my kids bought it for me LOL!,0
5110,I just put this on my computer having purchased it about a month ago from Amazon,0
5111,The first thing I am told is that Nolo is no longer updating this version,0
5112,Upon printing out a Minor's Medical Treatment release I am given two pages of legalize saying this may be out of date but I can upgrade at a significant discount by calling them,0
5113,As this is just the middle of 2011 maybe they should have called it Willmaker for the first half of 2011,0
5114,May be a good program but you'll never know because all they will give you is a disclamer and ask you to upgrade at more cost,0
5115,You can't bypass the two page disclaimer because it prints them out of order if you try to not print them,0
5116,This product was well worth the money,1
5117,"I reviewed various legal software/products prior to making a purchase (even had some older software) but this one was the most current, informative and served my purposes just fine",0
5118,It covers all the needs you may have to work with (legally that is),0
5119,Being someone who deals with reading legal docs and laws daily (not an attorney) and enforcing civil and criminal laws I would recommend it with no hesitation,0
5120,Just remember if you have a legal question about your document ask an attorney or paralegal to review it for you,0
5121,(Paralegals can review they just can't give legal advise (no I'm not a paralegal lol ),0
5122,"This product is quite easy to install and simple to use, but doesn't have much explanation about the laws of particular states and the different options available",1
5123,The forms are pretty basic,0
5124,They are good if you are leaving the bulk of your estate to one or two people and making a few specific bequests,1
5125,"I wanted to use this to update a new will, since my old one is about ten years old, but ended up just typing the new one in because my old form is much better for where I live",0
5126,"If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc",0
5127,") and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money",0
5128,"If there is anything complicated in your dispositions or instructions, I would recommend paying for an attorney",1
5129,A few hundred dollars now can save your heirs thousands of dollars in expenses and hours of heartache,0
5130,I like this program  since I don't have a complicated situation in dealing with the information to go into my will & testament,1
5131,It did what I needed it to do,0
5132,It is straight forward and lays out each step as you create your will,1
5133,This software is awesome and so easy to use and very helpful,1
5134,It covers all the important topics that need to be covered and makes everything very clear,0
5135,"It is very easy to use and navigate, similarly to other quicken products",1
5136,Software arrived and installed onto desktop with Windows 7 easily and quickly,1
5137,The product itself is bare basic,1
5138,"it doesn't lend itself to attachments or codicils; it is cumbersome to use for specifying anything beyond the basic ""I die and everything goes to this heir (or these heirs)""  There are more flexible products on the market that I'd recommend over this product",0
5139,"It's not expensive, so perhaps it will fit a group of customer needs satisfactorily; but, I was disappointed",-1
5140,This is the most thorough and comprehensive software program I have ever used without a doubt,0
5141,"Not only that, it is one of the easiest to use",1
5142,You can get overviews of what you want to accomplish and then get step-by-step entry screens to make it happen just as you want it,0
5143,I am 76 and had no problems using it,0
5144,I heartily endorse it!,1
5145,This product is excellent for a form to create all estate related documents,1
5146,"However, it lack the ability to edit the documents once created",-1
5147,It also does not allow to partition property like life estates or I missed the option,-1
5148,"Overall, it is good product to use as guide",1
5149,"Even though I haven't completed the entire program, it so far has been very thorough",-1
5150,The explanations and detailed directions are very helpful,1
5151,WillMaker Plus will get the job done for you,0
5152,"But! like all of these type of products, ""READ THE INSTRUCTIONS""",1
5153,"If you don't follow directions to the letter, you will be starting your form all over from scratch",0
5154,Take your time and don't hurry!,0
5155,It is okay the only thing i dislike about it is that I stay in Louisiana and the will part of this software does not let you make a will if you live in the state of Louisiana,0
5156,But other than that the software is pretty good to have for any other forms that you have that need to be made,0
5157,"If you're interested in buying Quicken Willmaker 2008, be aware that you can buy the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Willmaker-Plus-2008-Edition-Estate-Planning-Essentials-Book-with-CD-ROM/dp/1413307167/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Willmaker Plus 2008 Edition: Estate Planning Essentials (Book with CD-ROM)</a>&nbsp;which includes a fully functional copy of Quicken Willmaker 2008",0
5158,The book and software together only cost around $31,0
5159,We bought this to do our first will and were pleasantly surprised at the breadth of topics covered by the program,0
5160,"As a first-timer, I really cannot compare it to other will-related products, but it appears to be well worth the money",0
5161,"I don't own this, but have been looking for a will-maker software",0
5162,I live in Louisiana and it's laws are like no other state's laws regarding inheritance,0
5163,I checked out the NOLO website details and the documents prepared by this are NOT valid in LA,0
5164,"i haven't gotten into many documents yet, but from my general overview it is very easy to use",1
5165,This is the 3rd Nolo Willmaker software I've purchased,0
5166,"The Willmaker software is easy to use, is tailored for your particular state, and allows you to be specific or general in the preparation of your will",0
5167,I've needed to update my will several times because of the increase in family members and my personal computer changes,0
5168,Each version has been easier to use than the last,1
5169,This is a great program for people who don't want to pay a lot of money to an attorney to prepare their wills,1
5170,It is a great product if you have basis estate planning needs,1
5171,It is easy to use,1
5172,I was able to complete my Will within an hour,0
5173,I would not use it for more complex needs but it is perfect for a first marriage with or without children,0
5174,"If your asset exceed $1MM, you may want to go to an estate planning attorney",0
5175,This product is very simple to use,1
5176,I recommend it,1
5177,It will save contact information,0
5178,"If you have someone that you mention in any of the legal documents, you can pick that person and the software completes all of the information for you",0
5179,It will also duplicate your will for your spouse with just one click of a button,0
5180,This was a great time saver,1
5181,"As a layperson and one who continually procrastinated when it came to taking care of my personal business, I found Willmaker Plus 2008 an outstanding product",0
5182,It is very user friendly and makes it a breeze to complete essential documents,1
5183,"The software includes every important document to include wills, living wills, trusts, powers of attorney, guardianship, and many others",0
5184,"It produces first class documents, ready to be signed, and the accompanying book and software provide excellent advice",0
5185,I was able to complete all my documents in just a few hours,1
5186,I would highly recommend this product,1
5187,It was very easy to use for simple documents,1
5188,My husband and I made simple wills and advanced directives,0
5189,The program asks very simple and easy to understand questions and really walks you through the paperwork,0
5190,Definitely a easy way to make easy documents,1
5191,I would consider this only if my total net worth was under 10k,0
5192,For less than $500,0
5193,00 you can get an experienced lawyer in your own state and do it right,0
5194,"No, I am not a lawyer but I have been burned in court thinking that all the facts are on my side so why would I need a lawyer?  Wrong",0
5195,I lost in the first 5 mins,0
5196,based on a procedure matter,0
5197,If Uncle Fred challenges your will after you are gone and your estate doesn't go as planned your decendents and desires will be greatly disappointed in you over your cheap a** choice of a $19,-1
5198,99 will you bought off Amazon,0
5199,Started many of the documents,0
5200,Have not printed any yet,0
5201,"Program installed no problem and is simple enough to use, kinda like using a tax program",0
5202,Found this product to be easy to use and very thorough with instructions,1
5203,Installed the program and immediately prepared a Power of Attorney with no problem,0
5204,Instructions readily available,0
5205,Would definitely recommend,1
5206,Good basic information that will be sufficient for most people to prepare a will meeting their desire to pass on physical property,0
5207,"For those with complicated family ties, large amounts of property that will require sale to realize distribution you want to achieve, or large estates for which you want to reduce tax burdens as much as possible; get a lawyer",0
5208,"This program was relatively inexpensive to buy, and installed pretty quickly",1
5209,Filling in your information takes some time but the program does automatically fill in repeat information for you,0
5210,The only thing it could improve on is give a brief tutorial or information on the most common forms used or what you should include besides a will,0
5211,"It provides great information if you  know what your looking for, but a little difficult at first for a beginner who knows nothing about wills other then you need to have one! Great product overall",1
5212,"was able to set up a will, health care directive and living trust very easily",1
5213,the notarization of the documents was harder then setting them up almost,0
5214,Have had the program for several months and finally took some time to re-write my Will and health care documents,0
5215,2011 seems to be a big improvement over the earlier version I used (2006?),0
5216,"I was able to transfer over my basic information from my older Will, update, proof read it, and print it",0
5217,I like that it even asks for an Obituary (if you care to write one) OR an information page that would assist family in writing an Obituary for you later,0
5218,The directions seem thorough and easy,1
5219,After printing the pages I took them to a Notary for Witnessing and Notary work,0
5220,Very satisfied with this software and from the high number of 4's & 5's the majority of users also are,1
5221,"In many places it makes helpful suggestions, such as NOT printing an Obituary with your exact birthdate in the newspapers, due to the danger these days of I",0
5222,theft,0
5223,"If you're like us, you thought about getting something like this for a long time but since you're in good health and all is well, you put it off",0
5224,Approaching our 50's and losing friends our age has made us think twice about our invincibility,0
5225,This software is very easy to use and has had the added benefit of being a great conversation starter,1
5226,"Our brother, a lawyer, checked it all over and loved it, too",0
5227,The software installed easily on my windows 7 laptop,1
5228,Following the prompts I was able to produce a printable will for myself and my wife in about 10 minutes,0
5229,The next step is to print them and sign them in front of witnesses,0
5230,It's that easy and that fast and MUCH cheaper than paying to have it done professionally,1
5231,"There are may other documents you can produce with this software, but I have not looked at them",0
5232,"My only complaint, and the reason I only gave 4 stars, is that the interface looks very dated",0
5233,it looks like something from 15 years ago,0
5234,If you need a will don't hesitate to try this product,0
5235,"Software installed easily but as soon as I started the program I got a messsage that this version was no longer supported but I could buy an upgrade at a ""significantly reduced price""",0
5236,This is the 2011 version,0
5237,It should be supported,0
5238,It is the current version,0
5239,Should not have to immediately purchase support for a current application,0
5240,Very bad business,-1
5241,A friend died of cancer a few years ago and while he had over a year to prepare he didn't leave a will behind,0
5242,This shows that a will doesn't have to be difficult to create or expensive and you never know when you might need it,0
5243,Better than everything going to the state goverment,0
5244,"I haven't done a lot yet with the program, but already I'm impressed by how intuitive it is and well organized to explain and lead you along with the terms and actions needed to create personal affairs documents for this time of life",0
5245,"I and my wife's wills haven't been updated since we had our first child, so that was my goal in purchasing WillMaker",0
5246,"However, I've actually started with putting together the our health care directive documents first",0
5247,We are now in our sixties and health has become a priority for this time of life,0
5248,A lot of thought has gone into making this software truly user friendly,1
5249,I would recommend it to anyone on just my first foray into it's information,1
5250,especially for this time of life!,0
5251,There are multiple versions of Quicken Willmaker 2011,0
5252,"This version,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-WillMaker-Plus-2011/dp/1413313701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011</a>&nbsp;is sold as software and includes a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Little-Legal-Companion-Helpful-Advice-for-Life-s-Big-Events/dp/B000PY4T6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Little Legal Companion: Helpful Advice for Life's Big Events</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feature",0
5253,It does not however come with a printed manual,0
5254,"For those  who prefer manuals there's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Willmaker-2011-Edition-Book-Software-Kit/dp/1413312748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Willmaker 2011 Edition: Book & Software Kit</a>, which is sold as a book which includes the software",0
5255,Both versions include  a free download of Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law upon registration,0
5256,Also included is Nolo's Online Living Trust software,0
5257,This is a Windows only program,0
5258,I wish there were a Mac version,0
5259,But it works as advertised and s useful if the user does not have a complicated estate,0
5260,Nolo really does a nice job and the software is well organized,0
5261,"Quicken's WillMaker Plus 2011 is simple to install and comes with three free bonuses:  ""Your Little Legal Companion"" booklet that covers topics from Going to College to Planning Your Estate; an e-book, ""Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law""; and an Online Living Trust",0
5262,It also provides free online legal updates through 2011,0
5263,"The program is categorized into four main sections: Estate Planning, Executors, Home and Family, and Personal Finance",0
5264,"Examples: under Estate Planning, the documents include Will, Health Care Directive (Living Will & Power of Attorney), Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, etc",0
5265,"Under Home and Family, there's Child Care Agreement, Pet Care Agreement, Elder Care Agreement, Housesitting instructions, etc",0
5266,This program guides users using a simple questions and answers format by clicking on or entering relevant info,0
5267,I hammered out a rudimentary yet legal will and printed it in less than five minutes,0
5268,Overall: perhaps a bit oversimplified but sometimes simplicity makes the entire legal process easier to understand and execute for most users,-1
5269,Users requiring more detailed/complicated legal documents can reference Nolo's online resources or seek professional legal counsel,0
5270,"If you are looking at this product, then it is probably for you",0
5271,"If you had a large estate that was complicated, you would have already consulted a lawyer",0
5272,"Being that you are looking at this at Amazon, then this should easily fit the bill",0
5273,The standardized forms have been written by legal folk who have tried to ensure the estate or wishes of the author are granted,0
5274,Most judges will take these forms and understand the intent,0
5275,"However, be careful on tweaking in any way",0
5276,The smallest of things can lead to ambiguity and create messes later on that you were trying to avoid with this software,0
5277,If you need to tinker - get a lawyer,0
5278,Its not a bad product and was helpful in making out a will for myself and some friends but I thought that the software could be a bit more user friendly and I think it is a bit overpriced for what you get so 3 stars for now,2
5279,A total waste of money,-1
5280,"There is nothing in this to cover non-marital trusts, disclaimers, crummy powers and many other standard estate planning tools",0
5281,"Not even a discussion of joint ownership, whether it's a tenants in common or tenants with the right of survivorship",0
5282,"No discussion of charitable bequests, QTIPs or grantor trusts",0
5283,The type of will that can be produced from this is guaranteed not to save you anything in estate taxes,0
5284,"This program is remarkable, it really is",1
5285,"Included are lengthy, exhaustive lists, dozens of do-it-yourself legal documents, with versions valid in every state (except Louisiana)",0
5286,"Simple will,  living trust, powers of attorney, durable powers of attorney, revocable powers of attorney, disposition of estate, health-care directives, final arrangements, care-giver, and children and beneficiary documents",0
5287,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-WillMaker-Plus-2011/dp/1413313701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011</a>&nbsp;can save you and yours some serious money",0
5288,"not just the legal fees to prepare wills and trusts, but also through strategies that help you avoid probate",0
5289,"Probate is costly and time consuming, estates often take several years to wind through probate court before your beneficiaries",0
5290,"This program doesn't provide solutions for more complex estate planning, the kind required for estates with extensive holdings, say, multiple business and real estate interests",0
5291,"But for 90-plus percent of us, this will do the job",0
5292,"The program guides you through each form question by question - it's a bit rigid in it's navigation of the forms, but when you're finished you have a professional product a beautiful,

Also included in the box is a ""Legal Companion"" manual, chocked full of information and advice on all manner of everyday legal issues, from parking tickets to credit repair, from buying a used car to changing your name, from starting a small business to adopting a child",0
5293,This manual is a nice bonus to a valuable program,0
5294,My update from Willmaker 2004 to the current 2009 was worth the piece of mind,0
5295,"It was reassuring to know that at least for my state, there were no major or even minor legal changes to the Will requirement",0
5296,The program is exceptionally easy to follow and walks you through the creation of the will,1
5297,There are excellent definitions in the margin for the terms being used,0
5298,"Especially good, was the explanation of the duties and responsibilities and even options of the Personal Representative or individuals appoints as a Power of Attorney",1
5299,There is good flexibility to create a very simple will with very little input - or be specific as necessary,1
5300,"Good job on all the documents included!
Bruce Cole",1
5301,My husband and I will be living overseas for the next 3 years while our 2 adult children are still in the U,1
5302,Our last will was written when they were both infants and we knew it was over due for an update,0
5303,We did some searching and found Quicken Willmaker Plus 2009,0
5304,My husband loaded the program and was instantly impressed by how user friendly it was,1
5305,He had it finished in no time at all,0
5306,If you are looking for an easy and convenient way to write up your will this is the program to get!,1
5307,Its OK but much harder to use than older version,0
5308,You have to know or figure out who is who when they refer to people in the will? I had to redo it a couple of times and I am still not sure if its what I want? Its very hard to make specific requests for your family,0
5309,I think I will have to see a lawyer anyway to check it over? The auto type feature is a pain as it kept putting in my name instead of my son's and I had to go back and manually change it over and over again,0
5310,If you are a lawyer and understand Legalize no problem,0
5311,The CD enables a person to create exactly what they want into the documents they need,0
5312,More than one person can use it; like two people in the same household,0
5313,"It saved us over $1,000 because we did not have to go to a lawyer to get it done",0
5314,Just Wonderful,1
5315,I bought this product from a recommendation from a broker,1
5316,"It was so easy to create a will, living will, and other documents",1
5317,It has so many documents to choose from beyond wills and trusts,0
5318,"Care giver instructions and information, bill of sale",0
5319,Would recommend this product to anyone who wants a cheaper alternative to creating a legal will,1
5320,This software is fine for a couple with a couple of their own children,1
5321,"But any complications, like divorced and remarried couples with children from prior marriages, it is virtually useless",-1
5322,We found it easier to compose our own wills without assistance from Willmaker once we tried unsuccessfully to use Willmaker,1
5323,I was a little surprised with the lack of flexibility in the software,0
5324,"This product had all of the forms a small family would require in order to be prepared for emergency, tragedy, or legal mishap",0
5325,Good product,1
5326,I used the wills living will and power of attorney,0
5327,"Easy to use, good directions",1
5328,"Very easy to use, just click through and it generates all the paperwork you need for your will",1
5329,"Just get it witnessed, and your done",0
5330,"I haven't tried any of the (many) other documents that it can crank out, but it's worth it just for the will making part",0
5331,Installation was very easy on my Vista PC,1
5332,"Laws continue to change, so I like the availability of free legal updates through 2009",0
5333,I have already created several documents,0
5334,The process is very easy,1
5335,Documents you need to complete are suggested based upon your answers to a few simple questions,0
5336,Documents are tailored to your home state,0
5337,Help and examples are available at every step,0
5338,"The interface is basic, but effective",0
5339,"The program actually goes beyond estate planning, to include personal finance and home/family documents",0
5340,"My software came with a nice 200 page YOUR LITTLE LEGAL COMPANION paperback, and a free 500 page PLAN YOUR ESTATE e-book",0
5341,I can see why this is America's #1 estate planning software,0
5342,I highly recommend this software,1
5343,I used thisproduct for myself and another family member,0
5344,It did the work for me all I had to do is decide who and what :),0
5345,Everyone needs some form of will/trust/last wishes/living-will/etc,0
5346,"This product, though outdated, still has particular uses",2
5347,"You can use it to draft a NFA Gun Trust or other type of Gun Trust if you'd like, it's perfect for that",1
5348,"Be warned, this isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such",0
5349,"You need to do a good amount of research regardless of your purpose, and be informed when drafting things up",1
5350,"Overall, this is a great product",1
5351,"Very nice software to make up a very simple, basic will",1
5352,Came with a guide and clear instructions,0
5353,Would use again,1
5354,I was very happy with the product and also the fast delivery time!  Great price,1
5355,This product is really nice and helpful,1
5356,"No one likes the thought of having to make a will, but with our first child, we felt it was necessary",1
5357,This program really walks you through it step by step and it is cheaper then going to an attorney,0
5358,Found this version easy to use- I bought this instead of 2010 because the reviews were better,1
5359,"The software is really easy to follow, but nobody said anything about it being out of date before I spent the money",1
5360,Amazon could have been more on top of this,0
5361,Now I have to purchase an upgrade or buy something completely different,0
5362,I am loading the software as this is being written,0
5363,"I can't comment on the quality of the product, but I can say that when I attemped to register the product online I was informed that support (by [",0
5364,]) has expired,0
5365,Now what?  How will I know if everything is up to date?  This product should be pulled no matter how good it may be if you can't get updates,0
5366,"Given the nature of what it's for, not being able to get the latest updates can be a disaster later on",0
5367,I can't recommend it nor rate it higher than 1 star,2
5368,"Don't buy if you want support, just bought product Jan 11, 2010 when I went to register I was informed that I could not register or recieve support as product was out of date as of Jan 1,2010",-1
5369,For support you have to purchase upgrade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
5370,Excellent,1
5371,Very easy to use,1
5372,"2009 version much better than the new 2010 as the '09 includes programs like trusts that were taken out for 2010, and of course about 75% cheaper",0
5373,"I found the willmaker easy to use, review and change as needed",1
5374,the explanations of each topic were excellent,1
5375,updates readily available free,0
5376,tailored to your state so that will is in appropriate format,0
5377,would recommend it to others,1
5378,Great program that leads you through creating legal docs just like tax programs,1
5379,I went through making a simple living trust in about 30 minutes and printed out the 17 page doc that only needs a notary,0
5380,Customer service at Quicken advised the 2009 program has more functions bundled than the newer 2010 program and the 2009 version remains up to date for most documents and at a great price,0
5381,"I bought this program for my ailing, senior, computer illiterate father",0
5382,"I ""walked"" him through all the steps!  A few years later and I end up with the entire inheritance!  My family has no idea!  Best product ever!",0
5383,"I taught computer-related courses, mostly programming and database management systems, at a university for three decades",0
5384,"Had a second-semester programming student turned in this program as a final project, I would have graded it either a C+ or B-",0
5385,I thought the flexibility was weak and the consistency of document output somewhat sloppy,0
5386,"Having said that, there is little else available on the market and, at a low price of $25, it gives you the legal boilerplate you need and allows you to produce documents quickly if you have fairly simple situations",0
5387,"It helps a lot to also own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Acrobat-Professional-9/dp/B0018VF9EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Acrobat Professional 9</a>&nbsp;so you can tweak the",0
5388,"pdf documents produced to better meet your specific needs, which is what I did",0
5389,"Again, for $25, it gets the job done with little effort",0
5390,"This is outstanding to express your wishes regarding health decisions, financial decisions, etc",1
5391,"Power of attorney, various choices in various circumstances",0
5392,"If you have an exremely complicated life, perhaps you should see an attorney, but buy this one first",0
5393,This software is easy to install and use,1
5394,I was up and running in very little time,0
5395,I had an attorney friend review the document after I completed it,0
5396,While he didn't like the fact that I used software he said it created a good document,0
5397,Kudos to WillMaker,0
5398,This product was very easy to use and software every do-it-yourselfer should own to get their financial/legal matters in order,1
5399,It is essential to set up health care directives and financial power of attorney if you have an elder parent(s) you are taking care of BEFORE they become too sick or disabled to sign these forms,0
5400,This product was easy to use,1
5401,"I really got it just so I would have some of this paperwork done, notarized and 'in writing' incase the less than desirable happens",0
5402,There were things I hadn't thought of that it stepped me through,0
5403,You can make it as detailed as you'd like or as simple,0
5404,"I would suggest it for anyone who is looking to have these types of directives in a quick, simple and fast method",0
5405,"I am a lawyer, although I do not practice estate law",0
5406,"I bought this to draft wills for my wife and me, and it was very straight-forward to use and - I think - accurate",0
5407,"Lawyers will charge $1,000 for this, but the software really makes it quite easy",2
5408,What you lose is the ability to do really complex things and to have a lawyer hold your will in a secure place - where your heirs can easily get to it,0
5409,"Will execution can be a bit complex, but if you follow the instructions you should be fine",0
5410,"I have to be careful in this review, so please do not interpret this as my advice that the software is correct or that its advice is sound",0
5411,I'm just saying it was easy to use and I did not notice any errors when completing my own will,0
5412,I just started on my will using this program and I'm relieved that it's so user friendly,0
5413,My husband also thought it was easy,1
5414,"He's not computer savvy, so I thought I would have to sit with him during his use, but he handled it!!",0
5415,The product had all of the forms I needed to take care of my will/estate planning,0
5416,The instructions provided for an executor are easy to understand and very nice to have for my family,0
5417,Seems like a very good product for those doing fairly uncomplicated wills and directives,1
5418,Many helpful screens and explanations to assist in making informed decisions for how your will and medical directives should be set up,0
5419,This Quicken Willmaker Plus 2009 is great! It has saved me hundreds in attorney fees,0
5420,The program is intuitive and easy to follow,0
5421,"Just fill in the blanks, print, notarize and file",0
5422,That simple,1
5423,I highly recommend it,1
5424,For thiry-five bucks you cannot go Wrong!,0
5425,"I have not finished the will, but I have started, and I have reviewed all the documents included with this Program",0
5426,"This program goes beyond what I even hoped for, by including formats and forms for other necessary documents, such as Powers of Attorney, Health Care Directives, etc",1
5427,"It is complete, and the instructions make the procedure clear and simple",0
5428,I tried to start the will-making process on-line with Legal Zoom,0
5429,The program was difficult and without instructions,-1
5430,when I ran into a snag - and after multiple attempts to figure out an answer on my own - I finally gave up on Legal Zoom,0
5431,"Simple and easy, and comprehensive documents provided for estate, personal finance, home and family planning",1
5432,"Great item, had the 2002 version",1
5433,The new one has several inclusions which help one determine their path,0
5434,"Easy to use, understand and reasonably priced",1
5435,Will save you hundreds by doing the simple things yourself,0
5436,The average person will find this software a great thing to use,1
5437,The thing I didn't like about this program is that it is bare bones,0
5438,"I have updated my will in the past and the programs I've used asked for SSN and info like who holds your 401K, etc",0
5439,That way your executor can find these things,0
5440,This didn't even ask last know residence of people mentioned in the will,0
5441,"I will have to amend or stick a note in with the will for ease on executor, when I pass",0
5442,"However, if you are single or just want to leave everything to a spouse or child",0
5443,Easy to use,1
5444,Just received my copy of Quicken WillMaker and I am somewhat disappointed,-1
5445,It's not the product that I received but rather the product I have been using,0
5446,"For several years we have used  Broderbund Home and Business Layer and when I noted their current copy had the numbers ""2008"" on the package I decided to go with a newer package form Quicken that had ""2009"" on it",0
5447,I will use just one example,0
5448,"The creation of a ""will"" is much easier and much more complete on the Home and Business software",0
5449,Quicken does not make it easy to get all your information in the first time and I've had to go back to page after page to make corrections or addictions,0
5450,The end product on the Home and Business looks professional,1
5451,In fact their printed copy looks almost identical to a copy I paid several hundred dollars for,0
5452,Come to think about it the law firm may very well have used the Home and Business software,0
5453,"I'll just use both of them by checking one against the other when i c0omaplte a document, at least I'll do that for a short time as that will eventually get to be too time consuming",0
5454,Just my thoughts---yours may be different,0
5455,very easy to make your own Will -- I got the book version which has all the information in print plus software! [,1
5456,"What a wonderful alternative for making your own living wills, power of attorney and other important legal documents that you should have ready in case of an unfortunate mishap",0
5457,Quicken WilMaker Plus is very user-friendly and was extremely easy to install,1
5458,It is like an interview process asking question by question and then it generates all the information into the legal document,0
5459,Worried if you may not answer the question correctly or just not sure how you should answer it - this software has plenty of help and examples to cover all your doubts,0
5460,"Being that the program is updated online, you do not have to worry about the possibility of something being changed that would reflect your forms",0
5461,This update applies to state by state regulations as well,0
5462,"However, keep in mind that these updates are only good for the 2009 year and will not carry over to the next year",0
5463,I am extremely please with this software and would recommend it highly,1
5464,"This Windows ""program"" is a hodge-podge amalgamation of a variety of eBooks, PDFs, and help guides without integration and coordination",0
5465,Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application,0
5466,"Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information",0
5467,I'd suggest buying their books instead,0
5468,The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms,0
5469,"In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again",0
5470,Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there,0
5471,"When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point,",0
5472,doc is pretty standard,1
5473,Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader,0
5474,"Included in the program are ""checklists""  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as ""How to Form an LLC"" and ""How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting""",0
5475,All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves,0
5476,"In other words, pretty much worthless",-1
5477,"Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated ""Book Reader"" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends",-1
5478,"Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere",0
5479,"Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called ""Your Little Legal Companion"" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as ""Moving in with your Lover"" and ""Getting Old",0
5480,""" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning",0
5481,"Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use""",0
5482,"Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program",0
5483,Combined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting,0
5484,"However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually",0
5485,"As an owner of a small business, there are often times when I need a simple contract or legal document drafted up",0
5486,Time and resources are valuable,0
5487,Not everyone can afford to pay lawyers or legal aides $400+ to fill out some template,0
5488,This package gives you the convenience to do it yourself,0
5489,This library of forms and books is comprehensive and can save you a bundle,0
5490,"After installing and using it for a few weeks here are the pros and cons that I have come up with:

PROS:
- Simple and straightforward installation
- Easy to use
- Extensive collection of forms
- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference

CONS:
- fill-in process is required",2
5491,IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document,0
5493,"Overall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners",1
5494,The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise,0
5495,"They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you",1
5496,One really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can,1
5497,"You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!

Also:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print",1
5498,"Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012/dp/B005CELLZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012</a>",0
5499,"(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)

That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more",0
5500,"So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:

First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free",0
5501,"The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site",0
5502,"Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc)",0
5503,"But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price",0
5504,"I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo",0
5505,"com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each",0
5506,"So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2",0
5507,"They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more)",0
5508,"All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs",0
5509,"But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient",0
5510,I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms,0
5511,There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees,0
5512,"Also, none of the forms were usable ""as-is"" for me",0
5513,"Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used",0
5514,"And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free)",0
5515,Nonetheless I still give this 3,0
5516,5 to 4 stars,1
5517,"For me, it's all about saving time",0
5518,"There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating",0
5519,"I have been using this version for a while, and I had an older version of this software",0
5520,The short version of the story is that it works very well for giving you routine documents that you can use,0
5521,Its best for people who have a small business or like to rent property,1
5522,"Its certainly not good enough to replace a lawyer, but if you want to have an employee sign a non-compete agreement or a typical contractor agreement then its fine",0
5523,The world of law is so complicated that this sort of software is only good if you don't think you will really need to enforce these documents in court,0
5524,"In other words, use this when you want to have a signed document but you don't expect to need it",0
5525,I did not use it for any renter agreements but I think it would be very useful for that,1
5526,It did not have some of the special agreements that I need from time to time,2
5527,"But for the most part, its good enough",1
5528,"If you have any real risk in an agreement, I would still recommend you hire a lawyer from the beginning",1
5529,Quicken Legal Business Pro 2011 is meant for owners of small to medium businesses,0
5530,"However, it contains a large amount of information that makes it handy to non-business owners as well",0
5531,"Many subjects are covered, including buying and selling real estate, leasing, contracts, tax forms, managing finances, etc",0
5532,The software itself is fairly intuitive to use,1
5533,Nolo does an excellent job in bringing together over 100 contracts forms,1
5534,From buying goods to selling goods they have you covered,1
5535,More importantly the type of business type you plan to form,0
5536,"Knowning if you are going to be a partnership, a LLC, or an independent contractor and the legal agreement you should have in place is important",0
5537,"However, there still may be some confusion, so you should the advice or a lawyer",0
5538,Also the internet is your friend but of course be carefull of misinformation,0
5539,Creating document are easy,1
5540,"Open the document you wish to create, answer the questions you are presented with and your document is done",0
5541,The software also includes multiple forms,0
5542,Including various policy documents for when your business grows a little larger and you need to start implement various employee policies,0
5543,"There are employee agreements, non-compete clauses, NDA, and various tax forms",0
5544,"There are 5 ebooks included to help you business plans, loans, legal guide, employment law, and tax information",0
5545,This is a must have software for anyone just starting out in business,0
5546,It is invaluable but as I have already stated you still should be hiring outside legal help,0
5547,Highly Recommended,1
5548,This software is great for many different things,1
5549,Anywhere from buying a house without an agent to starting your own business,0
5550,"This software also provides forms and contracts that you can print out, which would save a lot in legal fees",0
5551,I'm glad I got this software,1
5552,"There is also advice on buying a new car, and things to look out for",0
5553,This is very valuable information,1
5554,A diverse and extremely useful package of downloadable legal forms suited for any small business or self-employed professional design to save them money,1
5555,I was  attracted  to LEGAL BUSINESS PRO 2011 because when I retired from my job in an industrial art firm I decided to freelance as a consultant,0
5556,"I could not have effectively operate my business without the IRS forms, Contact With Independent Contractor form and Confidentiality Agreement form contain in this package",0
5557,The cd also includes dozens of form letters and a decent financial program,0
5558,If these forms saves you one legal bill it is well worth it,1
5559,"I received the software on time which was great, yet the software itself is not particularly useful to me",1
5560,Some of the links within the program does not work (won't open to the webpage that it's associated with),-1
5561,"Furthermore, many of the documents don't really serve my intended purpose",0
5562,at least not at this time,0
5563,Best thing about the purchase experience is the price list on Amazon was way cheaper than Office Depots' (so I'm glad I didn't pay $70 for something I barely use) and the seller delivered it right on time; thus the three stars is due to pricing as well as fast and timely shipping,0
5564,The problems associated with the links not opening from the product dragged down the overall rating,0
5565,I've had this software for about 6 months now,0
5566,"And although I haven't officially used any of the forms yet, I find this software to be really good reference material",1
5567,I feel like I can rely on the information in this software more than I would from a random source I found on Google,0
5568,"Even with all the info, I don't think I would close on a property purchase without an agent and lawyer",0
5569,But I feel like there's enough documentation in this software that I could do my homework and educate myself before intelligently speaking to an agent,0
5570,"I probably won't use 75% of the information here, but it's very nice to know that information is available and reliable",0
5571,My husband and I own a small company and this software library has everything one would need to start a business and continue running it,0
5572,I highly recommend it,1
5573,This software is great,1
5574,It has a large selection of business legal forms ready for you to complete and customize,1
5575,It is so easy to use,1
5576,"You don't have to be a lawyer to work the software, but you might want to have one review the documents before signing",0
5577,I highly recommend this software,1
5578,I can think of lots of uses for business owners,0
5579,I got this because my wife and I are considering buying an existing business and thought this should help with drafting legal agreements,0
5580,"It does that, and fairly well",1
5581,"I can't say that it includes every single scenario that we were interested it, but it does cover a wide range of business types, LLC, PLLC, etc and it does cover different purchase methods, asset, stock, etc",0
5582,For us it was a very good start that we plan to have an attorney look at,1
5583,"Still I do believe is a good product, but not great, that may be a reflection on what this product is trying to accomplish, which is very broad and comprehensive",2
5584,"This is worth buying in my opinion, just don't expect it to produce a perfect document, without some tweaking",2
5585,"If you are planning on starting a small home based or small office business, this software/guide would be a nice tool for you to use; however, be aware that you are getting basic, generic information and forms, so you have to be savvy enough to pull in your own state/city ordinances & be able to draft documents that speak specifically to your business",0
5586,"This software package is a good start, and will lead you to where you need to be",1
5587,"However, don't think that it is a one-stop shop",0
5588,It is not,0
5589,"Do your homework, visit your secretary of state's website, visit your local government's website, and look at other on-line forms to help you draft the necessary agreements that you will need",0
5590,"NOTE: If you are a contractor, subcontractor or supplier be aware that this package does not discuss mechanics liens, which can be very tricky state to state",0
5591,The included e-books are a nice bonus,0
5592,"The ""Legal Companion"" book is a throw-away",0
5593,This has a fairly good set of standard forms that will cover many situations,1
5594,I would use this occasionally when the downside risk of making a mistake in a contract isn't all that high -- e,0
5595,", simple transactions with low value associated, where you might not use a lawyer anyway",0
5596,I think this set of forms is better than what I find when I just search for off-the-shelf forms on the internet,0
5597,"However, I wouldn't rely on generic forms for more important contracts -- I would consult an attorney familiar with your state law and particular circumstances",0
5598,"Another use would be to do a draft version that you'll have an attorney review, which should cut back on your legal fees",0
5599,Quicken Legal Business Pro Contract & Forms 2011 is easy to install and took less than 2 minutes,1
5600,"After installation, it will ask you to ""web update"" which I recommend in doing so (however not mandatory if you do not have online access at the time)",0
5601,This will keep all of your forms current and accurate,0
5602,The program is intuitive and will guide you through all the steps for the correct legal form,0
5603,The program has drop down menus of different categories and you choose the appropriate form,0
5604,Click once on the form and it will give you a description of what the form is for,0
5605,You are able to view examples of the document as well,0
5606,Double-click on the form and it will provide a more in-depth description of the form and what information is needed before you begin,0
5607,The program is very user-friendly and guides you through all of the necessary fill-in-the-blanks,1
5608,On the left of your screen is a pane that explains each section you are filling in,0
5609,"When you are done, you can view, edit and print",0
5610,The program has a section that is in PDF format that offers helpful hints and guides to running and starting a business to legalities and contracts for the business,0
5611,There is even an online section that is offered by Nolo that gives more information such as ways to find a business lawyer and an online legal dictionary,0
5612,This program is perfect for the beginner or a seasoned entrepreneur,0
5613,All the forms you would need are right here in one spot,0
5614,A nice touch is that it includes a book of legal advice for everyday life,0
5615,I am very impressed with the product and highly recommend it to fellow entrepreneurs,1
5616,I reviewed this product at the same time as Nolo's Corporate Records Handbook,0
5617,"The two compliment each other very well, and could help any business get off to a good start",1
5618,"This collection of forms and books covers the field of business information pretty well, from LLCs to corporations",0
5619,In the past when I've needed business forms I've spent time searching the Web to find something I could adapt to my use,0
5620,Now when I open this program I can usually find what I want in a couple of minutes,0
5621,It's a great time saver,1
5622,I would recommend this to anyone running (or starting) a small to medium sized business,1
5623,You can spend a lot of time surfing for information,0
5624,Or you can spend the $35,0
5625,45 (price as of this writing) and have what you need at your fingertips,0
5626,"My opinion, this is a no-brainer decision",0
5627,Buy the product,1
5628,The Quicken Legal Business Pro book and application is a terrific addition to my business software arsenal,0
5629,"Full of useful information, and a comprehensive collection of highly useable legal forms,  its a great help in getting your paperwork in order and standardizing your forms",1
5630,Highly recommended!,1
5631,I know there were a lot of complaints regarding this item that pdf forms are not fillable and that you can't get them in word,0
5632,"However, with Adobe Professional I had no problem copying the agreement and pasting it into word",0
5633,In addition many of the files which are related to contracts/agreements are exportable into a word processor as it asks you when completing the document,0
5634,The only complaint that I have with this is that it is not very detailed,-1
5635,For the very simple business the contracts are very acceptable,1
5636,"However for my accounting practice I just opened up I used the templates as a guide, then exported them into word and added a lot of content that was missing from knowledge I had from engagements issued to clients while I worked at a CPA firm",0
5637,Hope this helps others that are reading revies on this product before purchasing,0
5638,Quicken Legal Business Pro 2011 is a useful tool for established business owners and anyone wanting to start a new business,0
5639,It includes several very useful references as ebooks that can be read from within the program or on their own,0
5640,"The interface is easy to use, although it is not super-intuitive, and it walks you through the steps to creating a variety of legal documents",1
5641,"It won't replace an experiences attorney, but for most routine, and many unique tasks, it will allow the user to handle most of legal issues that face businesses quickly and easily",1
5642,"A very useful tool for any business owner or manager, it is well worth the cost",1
5643,Runs on Windows PC's,0
5644,"This is a pretty good piece of software if you're a small company, looking to save some money on legal documents",1
5645,"Lawyers can cost an arm and a leg (and part of the other arm too) where I live, so this kind of software is a good thing to have",0
5646,"I wouldn't use this if I were a huge corporation with 1,000 employees, though",0
5647,"But if you're small, and need some help with things like this, then it's probably right up your alley",0
5648,"On top of the documents you can prepare, there's also five legal books on the CD as well",0
5649,"I won't list them all, you can just look at the main product listing for that",0
5650,It also has another side benefit - it's not JUST for businesses,0
5651,Your home can get some benefit from this as well,0
5652,"This isn't a substitute for a good attorney, but definitely will get you moving on a number of legal issues cheaply",0
5653,This program is ideal for the small business owner and home-based business,1
5654,"It uses a simple question and answer format using a combination of questions, drop-downs and menu options",0
5655,You're guided through the process step by step,0
5656,"This can feel tedious if you're used to using a spreadsheet, but actually makes sense for the forms provided",0
5657,"It took about 10 minutes to create an invoice, but during that process the software stored my customer's information and my information - so next time it will go even faster",0
5658,"The program could not be any easier to use!  Installation was easy, and as a bonus for registering you're sent a download link for ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use"" - a 392 page version of the book",0
5659,"The program and the PDF file both depend on the nolo website for support, online forms, updates",0
5661,"Some of these services are free to registered users, others are free to all",0
5662,"I would recommend this to any curious christian, or curious nonchristian! I'm 20 years old and I enjoy using it! It's fun and informative, and the animations are my favorite part",1
5663,I purchased this as a gift for my wife,0
5664,"Not only does she love it, but our three-year-old son loves the videos",0
5665,"It is very easy to study the Bible, as well as look up information, cross-reference, etc",1
5666,I saved at least $20 by ordering online,0
5667,Great purchase!,1
5668,An excellent Bible Encyclopedia on a computer instead of a set of books! Very easy to use and very excessible!,1
5669,"Love this software!!!  I use it on a daily bases, and love the extra's",1
5670,"The only complaint I have is the scrolling arrow it is a bit to fast, so I use the bar instead",0
5671,Great resource for any age of beliver,1
5672,"Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,
  We finally have a program that reflects the Love and completeness any Christian would expect for the greatest occurrence of all time",0
5673,"We have allowed the world to take the lead in using technology to reinforce their own ungodly ways, but this program more then meets the challenge of catching up and conveying the Gospel to this techno age",0
5674,This software is more then worthy of our purchase and it is so reasonably priced for what you receive,0
5675,Ilumina continues in its own way to stimulate continued study and refreshment in G_d's Word in this so easily distracted society,0
5676,"From novice to the learned, ""Ilumina Gold Premium Software"" will place a smile onto the heart of every believer who is seeking G_d's Grace and Wisdom",0
5677,May His Love for You shine forth guiding you as you seek Him,0
5679,Many different ways to optimize this software,1
5680,Also the visual add-ons are great,0
5681,I would say the only thing holding it back would be a want for more media,0
5682,On the other hand a great bible study tool for home study and/or teaching use,0
5683,It's an excellent bible study program for all ages,1
5684,I highly recommend it to everyone,1
5685,It is full of biblical animations (amazing animations) like Shrek and Monsters Inc,0
5686,Has many bible studies as well as life application note,0
5687,Truly a must for those who want to study the bible!,0
5688,So far it has been great,1
5689,Our church uses it and think it will be very helpful with the pictures for the young ones to actually see,0
5690,Fantastic product recommend to anyone who wants access to the bible on their pc,1
5691,Great service from seller in America and even with shipping cost 60,1
5692,00 less than buying in UK,0
5693,There is so much to this cd that you keep discovering new things,0
5694,Easy to use and navigate around,1
5695,Well worth every penny,1
5696,"I titled my review ""Wow!"" because that is what I said the first time I saw the software in action",0
5697,"The information provided, graphics, layout, ease of use, and excellent cross-referencing all make this a must-have for any theological library",0
5698,Great for pastors or for home use,1
5699,I would highly recommend this product to any one who wants to learn more about the Bible,1
5700,"A very inexpensive bible library with excellent content using the Logos Libronix system, which is nice software",1

5704,"This product was previously released under the name ""Thomas Nelson Study Reference Library"" for about the same price",0
5705,"I could not believe that this offer was real, but it was!  You truly get what is advertised",0
5706,"In fact, I am still amazed at the extensive amount and quality of the information made available through this product",1
5707,The library is based on Libronix search technology,0
5708,"For this reason, there is really no limit to the books that can be added",0
5709,Installation of the library is not quite straightforward,0
5710,There is a registration step that is mandatory before the product registration grace period expires,0
5711,"It is essential that you back up the registration codes!  I wrote them on the CD label, and am glad that I did when I had to reinstall the software later following a hard drive crash",0
5712,"Another challenge is in installing the books on your hard drive, which you will probably want to do since hard drive space is far less of an issue than it used to be",0
5713,The installation of the software does not install all of the books as well--this is a manual step,0
5714,"The drop-down menus are complex and somewhat confusing, so you will need to read and follow the instructions carefully",0
5715,"You will find that a lot of Nelson Publisher's information is redundant between books, so that when you search for a narrow topic and find the results in five different books, all five books are likely going to say almost the same thing",0
5716,"However, what they do say is quite useful",1
5717,"One of the most outstanding uses that I have found from this library is the KJV expository by word, with word-for-word references to Greek and Hebrew equivalents",1
5718,A full expository research can be quickly performed on any Biblical text,0
5719,"With full Vine's and Strong's resources integrated into the product, this becomes an indispensable study reference library",0
5720,The SFL books are great study resources for Bible study groups or personal edification,1
5721,"Perhaps the greatest accolade that I can give this product is that, despite a year of heavy use, I have yet to access all of the information available in this library--not because it is hard to access, but simply because I just haven't had the time to explore the myriad of information available!",1
5722,I owned the original version and am happy to see that they finely got it together,1
5723,"Not perfect, but well on it's way to being close to it",2
5724,Future updates will work out the bugs no doubt,0
5725,Some have already been addressed,0
5726,Highly recommended!!!,1
5727,"I own the original Complete National Geographic from 1998, so purchased this for the additional 120 issues",0
5728,I am glad I did because the quality and content of the magazine is still excellent,1
5729,"I am also able to read some past issues, in which the text was unreadable on the original",0
5730,"The new interface is ok, but the searches just do not work for me",0
5731,I always end up going to the online National Geographic Magazine Index to actually find ALL the results on a search,0
5732,"Deducting 1 star because it will not run from hard drive with updates as of November 1, as advertised",2
5733,"The National Geographic support team is now saying the update should be available in December, but will it? National Geographic abandoned updates and user support with its original CNG",0
5734,"Regardless, well worth purchasing",1
5735,"I have just purchased the set and am keeping my finger crossed that what I've missed out in the former years, I would be able to read the interesting articles again and so are the awesome colour pictures",0
5736,I decided to buy this new version based on my satisfaction with the older version to the year 1987,0
5737,"I think I've made  up my own mind to buy this set,  as I understand that  every product would not be able to please each buyer 100%",0
5738,"!
However, this new set would provide endless fun, especially to while away  the dark and cold winter months in Canada",0
5739,My family and I would be thrilled to this set arrival,1
5740,it will be our Christmas present,0
5741,I trust National Geographic would produce the best products to all its eager fans,0
5742,Thanks National Geographic and Amazon,1
5743,com for making this product available to all of us,0
5745,"I've been playing around with this latest version of the ""Complete National Geographic"" and have a few thoughts to share",0
5746,I own one of the previous sets on CD-ROM,0
5747,"That set had a couple significant problems: You couldn't read the text of the articles, and all the magazines were scanned badly",0
5748,"This set has solved the readability and resolution problems, but has introduced a few of its own",0
5749,The earlier issues of the magazine have their photographs printed vertically so that the whole height of the page was used to display landscape photographs,0
5750,"With the magazine, and the earlier set on CD-ROM, you could rotate the pictures on their side and enjoy the whole photo blown up to full, (although limited), resolution",0
5751,"This set has no such feature, so you have to tip your head to view the photo and read the caption, and worse still, the photo can be displayed no wider than your monitor is tall",-1
5752,"You can zoom in on the picture for a better look, but it would have been nice to be able to rotate the pages so you could get a full screen view",0
5753,"Also, the search function is a sorry joke on this set",0
5754,"It uses these funky dials to select your date range, (what is wrong with pull downs I ask?), so it is more difficult to select an exact date range",0
5755,"Also, when you get your results they are displayed in this ""carousel"" format with the newest results first and the oldest rotating off into the distance",0
5756,"What is wrong with a simple list view and a scroll bar???

As was mentioned in an earlier review, these search results are truncated, so you know nothing about the date, or the key words, or anything about the details of the results",0
5757,"A good search function is kinda important for a collection spanning 120 years, and this one is close to worthless",0
5758,"Ah, just remembered something else about the search function",0
5759,"When you search for a particular brand name in the advertisements, clicking on the result takes you to the cover of the issue the ad is in rather than the exact page",0
5760,"Very annoying!

So, all in all, better than the old set in one very important way, the scans seem much improved, but the interface needs some serious work",-1
5761,I did notice that when I checked for updates it had already gone from version 1,0
5763,15 in the short time since release,0
5764,Maybe they will see the light and invest some effort into improving the interface,0
5765,"They have already got my money though, so I won't be holding my breath",0
5766,"""The Ancient Gamer"" review is absolutely correct about the problems which, when combined, earn only 4 stars for this DVD set at best",0
5767,"Also, there is nothing intuitive about searching",0
5768,"Finding the supplemental maps, for example, was very difficult",0
5769,"And once you find them, there are no tools (other than a couple of mouse clicks) I can find to help you zoom in or out or move around easily",0
5770,A detailed instruction book would have been very helpful,1
5771,"Overall, I am very impressed and pleased with this set",1
5772,"There are a few minor things that bother me, however, things that are not explained and given workarounds for due to there only being a 1-sheet program installation page",0
5774,There is no instuctions booklet provided in the box,0
5775,"There is an onscreen FAQ of sorts, but it doesn't begin to cover everything you need to know, making a booklet a must-have",0
5777,Many pages have their photographs oriented and displayed vertically onscreen,0
5778,If a function exists on the installation disc to make them appear horizontally side-by-side I can't find it,0
5779,"Having to turn my head sideways to view these vertical pictures/read the text every so often is sure hard on my neck! LOL

2",0
5780,No explanation (that I can find) is available on how to access/display the maps,0
5782,"As was mentioned previously in this thread, each magazine page must be zoomed manually since there's no option to lock the screen at a given magnification for as long as it's needed",0
5783,"This is a programming oversight that should have been addressed, prior to this shipping out to retail",0
5784,"All in all, owning this Nat-Geo set is proving to be a fascinating and worthwhile trip down memory lane",0
5785,"It's a lot of fun, revisiting all of the old Nat-Geo issues I remember reading (and used to collect) as a kid back there in the 1950s-60s",0
5786,I loaded mine to my hard drive and love not having to take the DVDs in and out,0
5787,"It took over two hours per DVD to load, but was worth it",0
5788,You just have to copy them from the DVD to a very specific folder on your hard drive,0
5789,"The directions are in the last of these FAQs in this link to the CNG FAQ page:

[",0
5790,"]

(If Amazon doesn't allow this link here, check one of my responses below this review -- I'll include it there too and maybe it can stay there",0
5791,")

One of the biggest negatives with this set is that the sideways pictures can't rotate, making them hard to read and enjoy",0
5792,And there are many such pictures,0
5793,"Hopefully they will come up with an upgrade soon to fix this, as they have received many queries about this",0
5794,"Although there are some negatives, overall, I am very happy with this set",1
5795,The huge plus is you get every issue of National Geographic in a relatively easily readable format when you use the easy-to-use magnifying and dragging features,0
5796,"If you have a 24"" monitor, it's pretty readable as is",0
5797,"With magnified reading, when you go to the next page, it resets back to zero magnification, and you have to re-magnify it",0
5798,"But it's fairly easy -- all you have to do is double click on the page, and it magnifies, and you can drag the text and pictures around as needed",0
5799,"They even include all of the advertisements, which they could have easily decided to omit",0
5800,(It's fun to look at the ads from long ago,0
5801,"For example, in the April 1916 issue, focusing on the national parks, there's an ad for newly established Cascade National Park, placed by Great Northern Railroad, reminiscent of the days when railroads affiliated themselves with different parks, to boost travel",0
5802,")

It prints out beautifully, and there is no readability problem with printouts",0
5803,"There is a handy readlist feature, where you can create your own readlists (very easily done) or look at readlists that the editors have prepared",0
5804,"There are approximately 33 of these already created readlists, covering such things as various editors' favorites, National Parks, The Universe, The Untamed, etc",0
5805,"Just scanning through these articles, it looks like these lists are pretty good and I see a lot of things I want to read",0
5806,One problem with these readlists is that they don't give the date of the article,0
5807,"You see something focusing on, say India, and you have no idea if it is from 1915 or 2005",0
5808,That makes a big difference to me insofar as my interest,0
5809,They should include the date of the issue in these readlists,0
5810,When I create my own lists I plan on always including the date,0
5811,"All in all, I am happy with this set, and would buy again, since it seems to be the best way to get all of national Geographic, short of buying all of the actual magazines for thousands of dollars",1
5812,"This is a beloved treasure of 120 years of knowledge and history, and a very valuable reference resource",1
5813,"There are a few points that ought to be noted:

>>The CNG has poor quality control and customer support over this product",0
5814,"It relies heavily on customer feedbacks to become aware of missing pages and issues, and took very long time (18 months) to address few of the reported bugs",0
5815,"The Complete National Geographic will be incomplete with missing items such as:
- Jul 1942 and Feb 1992: Pages missing, causing pagination problems in the issues with double page spreads not appearing on facing pages",0
5816,- Mar 1996: Page 35 is missing,0
5817,"- From 1991 to 2008, at least 30 maps are reported missing",0
5818,Examples: The World War II double map supplement is missing from Dec 1991,0
5819,The Sep 2000 map is missing,0
5820,"The ""100 Years of Flight"" supplement in Dec 2003 is missing",0
5821,The Jerusalem's Holy Ground map is missing in Dec 2008,0
5822,>>The Complete National Geographic contains National Geographic Magazine published through Dec 2008,0
5823,"National Geographic announced ""The Complete National Geographic"" users will be able to add to their collection after purchasing the product by downloading annual updates on a subscription basis from the internet",0
5824,Content updates for CNG will be available after the print editions of the previous year have been published,0
5825,CNG released an updated edition of this DVD set and a 2009 annual update DVD ($14,0
5826,95) in Sep 2010,0
5827,The feature to purchase annual updates online wasn't ready until CNG patch 1,0
5828,65 (requires Adobe Air 2,0
5829,6) released in Apr 2011,0
5830,Content update purchases have to be made through the CNG software interface,0
5831,Stand alone archive files for the purchased content updates may not exist for archive and repeat/multicomputer installation,0
5832,">>Updates need to be installed to add missing or fix corrupted pages such as in Apr 1913, Dec 1930, Mar 1950, Apr 1953 (entirely missing), Sep 1960, Aug 1970, Jan 1977, Jul 1979, Feb 1992, Feb 1993, and Dec 2003 issues",0
5833,"However, updates have to be downloaded and installed through the software interface; there isn't an independent update installer for archive and repeat installation",0
5834,>>Either the digital magnifier that comes with the software or the maximum zoom needs to be used to clearly read the texts on your monitor,0
5835,An ASCII text PDF resolution of the scanned pages shouldn't be expected,0
5836,>>The patch (revision 1,0
5837,26) to copy DVD content to local drive was released for Windows in Jan 2010,0
5838,It takes many hours to copy all 6 DVDs to the hard drive,0
5839,This is great it allowed me to get 30 years worth of NG off my living room bookshelves,1
5840,I bought it as a gift for my husband who had refused to part with the print versions,0
5841,this was the biggest waste of money in my life,-1
5842,These folks should be drawn and quartered for sending out such garbage,0
5843,"I say the whole 8 CD set sucks big TIME, so Y2K that looser",0
5844,I am happy with that I bought a used edition of National Geographic (outdated by ~8 years),0
5845,The price and delivery were right and the disks worked as expected,1
5846,Thank you,1
5847,excellent item as expected,1
5848,After some familiarization and loading all DVDs on an external hard drive this product is very useful,0
5849,One handicap is not being able to extract selected text and using it in a text to speech reader,0
5850,This can be real handy for weak and tired eyes and listening to it as bedtimeme stories,1
5851,"However, there is a way to overcome this: Print selected pages to MS OneNote and use the Extract Text function to create a text or PDF file",0
5852,This works quite well with the Zabaware or Halreader,1
5853,Still use this,0
5854,Works great on my Mac with Yosemite,1
5855,good product,1
5856,bought used from amazon,0
5857,nice collection,1
5858,This older version is so slow that you will be in need of geriatric supplies before you are finished,0
5859,Runs like tar on my Mac desktop,0
5860,Not recommended!,-1
5861,Amazing collection,1
5862,and saves a lot of space,0
5863,Very practical and easy to use,1
5864,A must for all serious collectors,0
5865,The magazine part is wonderful,0
5866,"The maps part is horrible, does not work, and should be cause for a law suit",-1
5867,Think the above pretty much says it all,1
5868,Doesn't leave much to the imagination,0
5869,Pretty dumb system that requires you to elaborate on something so obvious,0
5870,This product arrived very quickly,1
5871,It is in very good (like new) shape,1
5872,"It is certainly a GREAT deal better than the old CD-ROM version of the Complete National Geographic, however the video features could use a bit of change",0
5873,"But, overall I am satisfied",1
5874,"However, I rate it 4-star",1
5875,"I would however, rate it five-star if someone merely bought it for the purpose of keeping these issues on hand in case they ever needed them immediately as a quite reference material!
The software installed like a breeze, so for this thing I am well pleased",0
5876,"Anyway, thanks for your time!
God bless!
God is life!
Human life begins at conception!
Human fetuses are merely unborn infants!
What many often hear called ""abortion"" is in reality infanticide!
Jesus Christ is the Son of God; He is Lord and Savior; He died for the sins of the world and was arisen again on the third day!
Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness!
A word against the Holy Spirit cannot and will not ever be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come!",1
5877,The DVDs loaded and are view able so I am very happy,1
5878,Honestly after loading them though I haven't found a great interest in viewing the old issues,0
5879,"Oh, COME ON, ALREADY!  Beautiful graphics (it is National Geographic after all), but using it is like a slow Nile vacation on a raft",1
5880,"Sorry, National Geographic, I'm not enjoying the ""relaxing"" pace and unresponsiveness of Adobe's AIR interface",0
5881,It is a throwback from 1995,0
5882,"National Geographic, you can do better",0
5883,(Perhaps a quick call to Google can help speed searching and presentation?),0
5884,"This was given, by my children, to their Father for Father's Day 2012",0
5885,He is enjoying the set and says the quality of the CDs is excellent,1
5886,"In the interest of full disclosure,I purchased this item directly from National Geographic, not Amazon",0
5887,"After an initial problem that had me on the verge of sending it back for a refund, I found that an uninstall and reinstall of the application solved the problem",0
5888,It now works great,1
5889,I'd recommend it to anyone interested in reading the old issues,1
5890,"The program is easy enough to install, and it works pretty well for what it is",1
5891,"You can read and browse each magazine, zoom in on articles, print, etc",0
5892,It's a very nice program,1
5893,Now the rough part,0
5894,"I bought the cd version, and the dvd version fixes this somewhat, but there is still a little to say about it",0
5895,"If you want portable functionality, ie laptop, you either need to take the dvd or 8(?) cds along, or copy the contents to your hard drive",0
5896,This comes at approximately a 50 GB hit on your hard drive,0
5897,"While not a dealbreaker for me, I can see how this would be a major putoff",0
5898,"Once past that the only thing I would have liked to see would be a continuation of the program being developed, and to a point it has, but you have to buy any addons, and the next years magazines was almost as much as I paid for the whole program",0
5899,Most things I Review I say yep or nope,0
5900,So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review,0
5901,Received the order fast and it works on snow leppord! Installed on my MacBook pro in a matter of minutes,0
5902,Packaging was like new,0
5903,National geographic rocks and is faster than the new version since I have older hardware,0
5904,"Also, it comes with free updates",0
5905,What a great Product,1
5906,"It's another incredible feat of computer magic that National Geo was able to condense well over 100 years of issues, including every word, picture, map and advertisement, into 6 DVD's",0
5907,"Navigation through the entries is superb and extras, such as trivia games are a real plus",1
5908,"To top it off, the price is amazingly reasonable",1
5909,"Thanks, National Geo!",1
5910,"IN SPITE OF SOME NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON THIS SET, I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY FROM A WELL-KNOWN DISCOUNT BOOK DEALER AT A FRACTION OF EVEN THE AMAZON PRICE",0
5911,"I FIGURED EVEN WITH THE IRRITATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ROTATE THE PICTURES, IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH IT ANYWAY",0
5912,IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN AFTER I INSTALLED IT AND I DOWNLOADED THE LATEST SOFTWARE UPDATES THE ABILITY TO ROTATE THE PICTURES WAS NOW AVAILABLE,0
5913,"AT SOME POINT, NG MUST HAVE HEEDED THE COMPLAINTS OF ITS FANS AND FIXED THE PROBLEM",0
5914,"THANK YOU, NG!",1
5915,Great purchase,1
5916,It arrived on time and it has all the great content it advertised,1
5917,It has all the content from the beginning of the magazine and it was a great value for the money,1
5918,I read a lot about issues with the updates but to be frank,0
5919,There is a lot to explore before you run out of content! I will try to go through all the content before I make the update and if it doesn't work I think I got a fair deal of content for what I paid,0
5920,I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who likes this magazine,1
5921,I really can't rate this--I've never been able to make them play on any computer,0
5922,It seems like I always need to download yet another program,0
5923,You do NOT simply stick in the DVD & watch it,0
5924,Probably just my own ignorance--I wish they were easier to use,0
5925,Have you ever known anyone that hated National Geographic?  I have not met anyone yet who was unable to find something that they really liked about this magazine,0
5926,"With this set you get some pretty neat stories, photos and old ads",1
5927,"I have trouble wit the search feature, but the rest works pretty cool",1
5928,I cannot wait for my nieces and nephews to come over so I can share with them,0
5929,"My son loves National Geographic magazines, and so we gave him this set for Christmas",0
5930,It turned out to be his favorite gift,0
5931,"He spends hours pouring over the older issues, and even reading some of the articles",0
5932,We use Ubuntu Linux and so I had a little worry that it might not work under Linux,0
5933,"Though the DVDs didn't come with it, I found the installer on the web here:

[",0
5934,"]

It works nicely without wine, using Adobe Air",1
5936,I owned a previous version of NG on CD from 2000,0
5937,It had an intuitive interface that made it easy to find articles and to simply browse through issues,0
5938,This is lots of fun when you go back to the turn of the 19th century and see that they're talking (even then!) about the problems of obesity in America,0
5939,"Or in the very first article about Titanic (written around 1920 or so) where they mention how they are out there on a ""clean"" oil-burning boat",0
5940,"LOL!

Sadly, this version tries too hard to be fancy in its interface, and as a result it ends up getting in the way",0
5941,"Nothing is intuitive, and you spend a great deal of time wrestling with the search feature",0
5942,"I tried to find a map that I know NG published, ""Ghost Fleet of the Outer Banks",0
5943,"""  I saw a framed copy at my last job",0
5944,The DVD set's search feature tells me it doesn't exist,0
5945,And that's even when I just search for Ghost or Outer Banks or Fleet,0
5946,"It's nice that this version includes the maps from over the years, but the interface is very, very frustrating",2
5947,"my only regret is that being old school, I loved looking at the magazine pictures; that being said, this is a great collection of natural history",1
5948,I'm really disappointed,-1
5949,"It has been over 4 months that I ordered my item and after a first loss, it seems that it happened a second time",0
5950,Is it Rover Mall or US Postal fault?,0
5951,Part of the hidden aggravation is that I occasionally receive error messages after I installed this,0
5952,"Therfore, I shall never be able to use this  upgrade",0
5953,"I have used the cds for a long time with great happiness and if I can find a buyer for this then , I shall sell it soon",0
5954,"As an owner of Complete National Geographic set, this attempted improvement is a little disappointing",-1
5955,I own it but cannot use it as specified in the operating instructions which I have in the booklet,0
5956,This is truly amazing having every edition from 1888,1
5957,I was able to load all the files directly to my PC so I don't have to swap the DVD each time,0
5958,Why isn't this just a USB drive or a special series of PDF files do download by decade or something,0
5959,"I mean, who would want all of these discs?  I even settle for a special iPad with this bug free and pre-loaded or preloaded on a laptop for students",0
5960,Ditto for Ency,0
5962,And do it quickly before Google and Wiki scan them all for free and no one gets paid because of their book search features for which they never asked permission of copyright owners to digitize or make available,0
5963,If this were a USB drive I'd buy it,0
5964,Even Comic Book Viewer fans know that no one wants this in disc form,0
5965,Great set at a great price,1
5966,A must-have for anyone who's glued to NG magazines or TV channel,0
5967,The interface is a little sluggish but I'm fine with that,2
5968,Worth it,1
5969,I got this as a gift and took a while to get to installing it,0
5970,"Unfortunately the software is slow, clunky, insists on playing loud music every time you start it",-1
5971,I'd love to use it but the interface is as terrible as it is slow,2
5972,There is a tiny bit of goodness in that the software allows you to load all the DVD's onto a local drive,0
5973,I can't say that it works as the whole thing is to broken to bother with the time to make it work,0
5974,Oh and it would be nice if they said somewhere on the box what the dates covered are,0
5975,1888-2008 as it turns out,0
5976,Since the box doesn't even contain a copyright year for the content it's hard to tell that from the box,0
5977,"""Every Issue since 1888 makes it seem like they might have issues from 2009 or even early 2010 on there",0
5978,but not so,0
5979,This was a complete waste of money,-1
5980,I am angry,-1
5981,Thankfully I still have the magazine collection,1
5982,I am a photographer and I love National Geographic,1
5983,"I was so excited for this product to come out and have over 100 years of National Geographic at my fingertips, but using it has been disappointment",-1
5984,It is a little bit of a hassle to have to change out the DVD every time I want to view a magazine in a different collection,0
5985,"The use of it is pretty self explanatory, but it lacks the ability to be used the way I want to use it",1
5986,It is really just a glorified PDF of all their magazines,1
5987,"I was hoping it would be more like a Kindle or other book reader where you could make notes, highlight right on it or flip pages better",0
5988,Fantastic DVD collection; easy to use,1
5989,I have enjoyed going back to the very first National Geographic articles I enjoyed reading as a child in the early Sixties,1
5990,Highly recommended!,1
5991,"Whoever decided to re-market this National Geographic content this year should be given one more chance to get it right, and if he/she can't do it soon, should quit or be sacked",0
5992,"National Geographic, I expect nothing less than a FULL REFUND and/or a FULLY FREE copy of this DVD collection when you finally manage to get it right and rerelease this, again",0
5993,"In 2002 NG made the content from 1888 on available on CD but I held off because the software was rumored to be full of bugs, slow, prone to constant crashes and scanned at very low quality low resolution",0
5994,"So I held off until today and bought the DVD version when I saw it in a nice new package, advertised as being good with both PCs and Macs, thinking that in all those years they would have gotten their act together",0
5995,"WRONG! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE SOFTWARE, IT IS SIMPLY FRUSTRATING EVEN FOR EXPERIENCED COMPUTER USERS",-1
5996,This is a real shame because the content of the National Geographic Magazine has always been absolutely superb; but what an insult to all those great writers and photographers for NG to package it in such a horrible and virtually unusable interface,-1
5997,"I followed every direction to install it on both an internal, then an external hard drive",0
5999,I tried the software updates and even they also Failed to install,-1
6000,"Even resorting to running the 'program' from each of the seven disks separately (which means you can't search the entire collection for specific words or information anyway), it was painfully slow to load each page, or to even try to turn each page because it does two or three and then the 'program' invariably seizes up or crashes",0
6001,And this on a brand new Macbook Pro,0
6002,"Fail! The text is UNSEARCHABLE because NG- unbelievably - scanned all those magazines improperly at such low quality and haven't, it seems, gone back to try to fix this root of so many problems",-1
6003,Fail and CHEAP! And their 'Enhance Text' feature is virtually worthless,-1
6004,I'm young so I can't even imagine what a chore trying to read this would be like for someone with failing vision,0
6005,"NG should contact whoever did the New Yorker online, because that software works very well, as it should when you pay for something",0
6006,"Such great potential content, but such absolutely horrible software",2
6007,BUYER BEWARE! I feel totally ripped off,-1
6008,What a shame,-1
6009,I picked this up for my dad for father's day,0
6010,"On one hand it is an absurd amount of content for one package, which is pretty awesome",2
6011,"Also, its great fun to see the development of the magazine since 1888 (you wouldn't believe how much pure text there was in the old issues!)

However, the software is horrendous",2
6012,"Its slow, clunky, pointlessly complicated and all around crummy",-1
6013,Its absurdly complicated to install the whole thing on the hard drive (so you don't have to constantly swap DVDs when looking at issues throughout the years),-1
6014,"Why, oh why, did they not just give you some pdfs or something??",0
6015,I was very pleased to discover that the National Geographic Society had re-issued its complete set of issues since 1988,1
6016,"My father-in-law was Maynard Owen Williams, who served as Chief of the Foreign Editorial Staff of NGS, and whose articles and photographs were published between 1918 - 1953",0
6017,"I was looking for a particular article he had written, published in the December 1927 issue, entitled East of Suez to the Mount of the Decalogue",0
6018,I found it easily and was able to print out this article in its entirety,1
6019,Installation of the Complete National Geographic required installation of a free Adobe product called AIR,0
6020,This was not difficult to do,0
6021,"The Complete National Geographic installation was a bit more complex, but I had no problems in installing it",0
6022,"Recently we moved from a large home, in which we had our 50 year collection of NGS magazines, to a smaller independent living residence",0
6023,"We had to give up our NGS magazine collection, donating it to a school",0
6024,The Complete National Geographic DVD set now will enable us to access any particular article and to browse anywhere,0
6025,It is a wonderful product and we are pleased to own it,0
6026,"This DVD set replaces a much earlier set of CDs issued many years ago, which was difficult to use",0
6027,The National Geographic Society no longer supports that earlier CD set,0
6028,I purchased this as a gift for my father and he says it is fantastic!,1
6029,"After reading the reviews here for this product for some time, the price dropped below $35 and I decided to take a look at it",0
6030,I had no problem installing it or copying the dvd content to a hard drive,0
6031,The early issues are actually more useful than more recent ones,0
6032,No color photographs in the early issues,0
6033,The scanning and compressing of color images is so bad that I would be embarrassed to publish such an image on my website,0
6034,I'm a photographer and this isn't rocket science,0
6035,One can compress images and still get quality worth showing other people,0
6036,NG should be ashamed of themselves for degrading the work of so many superb photographers over the last century,0
6037,I won't comment on the interface or search functions,0
6038,Who cares if they work with such pitiful photograph scans,0
6039,This product is very well done and in a small package which opens a door to the world scene,1
6040,National Geographic has always set the highest standards in reporting the nature of our existence,0
6041,I have supported them since 1961 and had their magazine stored in my home so that I could always refer to any article that I wished to,0
6042,This took up a lot of space and with this new product I now able to review this magazine at any time and it takes very little storage,0
6043,"Also, I did not have on hand all the the magazine that this product covers",0
6044,I look forward to referring to it many times,0
6045,The Complete National Geographic is a massive collection of every issue from 1888 - 2008,0
6046,"That means 120 years of one of the world's most amazing magazines, all digitized and capable of being loaded onto your computer",0
6047,"The nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some ""printing"" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material",0
6048,"The bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents",0
6049,"The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired",0
6050,"The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads",0
6051,"Drilling down to specifics is not as easy as idly thumbing through issues, and thumbing through issues can also be a bit tedious",0
6052,It's important to keep in mind that the National Geographic Society are not Wikipedia:  information presented here was the well researched and chronicled *at the time of printing*--older issues will not be brought up to date with the world's latest discoveries,0
6053,This collection exists simply as a way to see the massive collection of the National Geographic Society that spans over a century of traveling the world and absorbing its information,0
6054,"If the interface were a little better, this would be a superior collection",1
6055,"As it stands, it is still quite nice",1
6056,I've been reading the reviews of this Nat'l Geographic collection to help me decide whether or not to get it,0
6057,One of the objections I've observed several times is that some images are presented rotated & are hard to view without contortions,0
6058,"I'm curious if anyone has tried the following techniques to rotate your screen image:

1",0
6059,"The simplest approach, for Windows users, is try the built-in Ctrl + Alt + [Arrow Key] hot-key sequences available on many PCs",1
6060,"Ctrl + Alt + [right, down, or left arrow key] will rotate the screen display clockwise",0
6061,Ctrl + Alt + up arrow will return the display to normal,0
6063,"There is a free download ""iRotate"" offered by EnTech Taiwan which provides access via a pop-up screen & is accessible from the system tray once installed",0
6065,"Right-click an empty spot on the desktop & select ""Properties"" to bring up properties for the display",0
6066,There may be an option to rotate the screen among the various settings available,0
6067,"However, this approach is less convenient as you generally have to go through the same motions to set it back to normal",0
6068,Caveat: Rotating your screen may cause your desktop icons to be rearranged,0
6069,This is a great product in concept,1
6070,National Geographic is a great magazine and there is a ton of good information contained on these discs,1
6071,The problem is the program is laggy and it is difficult to find some features,-1
6072,"In addition, every time you want to read an article, you have to find the correct DVD (1-6) and place it in the drive",0
6073,I typically don't keep software sitting out on my desk so it's a bit of an inconvenience,0
6074,"I know having all that information on your hard drive would take up a huge amount of space, but it would be nice to have faster access",0
6075,Overall I gave this product 3 stars,2
6076,"I like the idea of it, but I rarely use it because it's too slow/aggravating",2
6077,I'm not saying anything in this review that hasn't been said in many of the other reviews and in more detail,0
6078,"After drooling about the CD-based offering of this product quite a few years ago, but not buying, I ran across this for $35 at an un-named retail chain, and I happily laid out the cash for it",0
6079,"Who hasn't spent hours and hours as a kid or even an adult, just thumbing through issue after issue of National Geographic, being transported to places and times so fantastic, they almost seemed like fairy tales",0
6080,The content of these disks is phenomenal,0
6081,"Over 120 years of incredibly interesting and well-researched stories and content we've come to know and love from National Geographic Society, conveniently loaded on 6 DVD's, providing super-easy access for endlessly entertaining reading and browsing",0
6082,"But that being said, that was the no-brainer portion of creating this product, which would be hard to get wrong",0
6083,"The ""goods"" were there, they only needed to transform the media",0
6084,Just scan and digitize each page of roughly some 1400 issues,0
6085,"Not a fun process, I'm sure, but easily doable with today's technology",1
6086,Next step?  Determine some storage media that easily lets folks peruse that bountiful bunch of data,0
6087,DVDs are a logical choice given DVD players-readers are ubiquitous on PCs and laptops nowadays,0
6088,Last step?  Design a user interface that lets people as efficiently and effectively as possible access and explore all that wonderful content they so painstakingly transformed into this digital format,0
6089,"And unfortunately, THIS is where they seriously dorked it up",-1
6090,They had the Mona Lisa and bought a cheapo frame from Wall-Mart to put it in,0
6091,"yeah, that wry, semi-smirking face still looks good, but it's not the treatment the lady deserves",0
6092,"Possibly inspired by some other software, it seems NGS decided to design a search and browsing interface from the ground up",0
6093,"When it works, it's not a BAD interface, BUT IT'S BUGGY AS HECK!  It freezes half the time when I try to open a specific issue to browse (exiting the software and relaunching it usually fixes that)",0
6094,The search engine/interface is frequently slow--and not just because of the DVD spin-up lag--and frequently freezes up as well,0
6095,"I downloaded and installed the updates, and although it helped a bit, those aforementioned problems still exist",0
6096,"When I activate the zooming bar to zoom in and out of the page image (which hovers over the page image), and I click on it to drag the zooming bar, it grabs and moves the page underneath it instead",0
6097,"They could have studied Microsoft Encarta (which isn't fabulous, but it is effective) or something similar and made a MUCH more usable interface",0
6098,Of course they could actually fix the bugs in this product as it is and EASILY improve it as well,0
6099,"What the heck was NGS thinking?  The only REAL work needed to make this a great product was a nice, stream-lined, browsing interface that let people simply enjoy the product they've slowly crafted over the last 120 years",0
6100,"How could they ignore the last critical piece of the project, and rush this thing to market?  Ouch",0
6101,"And given the fact other reviews indicated these problems from late last year (2009) and they STILL haven't been fixed as of May 2010, it's WAY bad mark on their reputation for quality that NGS should value more than this product indicates they do",0
6102,"Lastly, I somewhat agree with the comments about the text quality",0
6103,"Easily think it could have been better, but for me it's fairly readable after some zooming",1
6104,"Even with all the above-mentioned problems, and several content omissions ID'ed in several other reviews, this is a very good product",1
6105,"But that's because of 120 years of hard work, the writers, photographers, and editors put into producing National Geographic",0
6106,NOT the production team who put together this DVD product,0
6107,"Had both parts been equally awesome (if that's even possible), 10 stars wouldn't have been enough for this product",0
6108,Shame on you NGS,0
6109,get your act together,0
6110,"Bottom line:  though problematic, for only $45 having 98% of ALL of the National Geographic issues at your finger-tips is too much to pass up",0
6111,"If you've spent as many hours getting lost in National Geographic as I have, I expect you'll think so too",0
6112,Before buying this DVD set i read most of the reviews posted here,0
6113,"I had great luck installing  the complete DVD set on my drive after, FIRST: going to the National Geographic web site and downloading the software from them along with Adobe Air, SECOND: use the browser interface that i just installed to download all dvd's on your hard disc by clicking ""preferences"" and then ""install options"" (confirm the location) The software prompts you for each dvd and took me less than an hour per DVD",0
6114,The information i gained at the NatGeo site informed me that they will have a fix for page rotation due out soon so keep checking for program updates,0
6115,I find this product very fine indeed including the browser interface,1
6116,For the most part I`m finding the Complete National Geographic on 6 DVD-ROMS absolutely fascinating,1
6117,"However, the Search function is apparently designed for 17 year old teen-age geeks",0
6118,Their Help section is extremely involved and I finally gave up  trying to access the famous fold out maps,0
6119,"So, a word of warning here, if you`re a 75 year old computer challenged guy like me be forewarned",0
6120,"Oh, also one issue that is a concern is the inability to rotate images",0
6121,"Many of the earlier issues printed landscape photos so that you had to turn the magazine, which, of course is no  problem, but on a computer it is a bit awkward to have to turn your laptop screen around or look at it sideways",0
6122,"Anyway, I understand that a update in the near future will address this issue",0
6123,This was a gift from our son who lives in Canada,0
6124,"What a DVD! Ease of finding specific information readily available whenever it is needed!  We have over 100 magazines, some dating as far back at 1926",0
6125,This new reference form is perfect!  Thanks,1
6126,"Of all the ways to package an archive of printed material, this is one of the worst",-1
6127,It is either a completely amateur job or a serious attempt at the copyright holders to make it as painful as possible for anyone to access the material,0
6128,The user interface is absolutely abysmal,0
6129,No browser-like interface that you find on quality products like Encarta here; you can only move forward,0
6130,And even on a high-end system (mine is an i7 3,0
6131,"6ghz with 8gb memory), the interface runs like a slug",0
6132,They apparently tried to make the thumbnails work like Apple OSX's dock but with horrible results,-1
6133,"The theme, which you can't change, is everything's black",0
6134,"If your eyes aren't very good then this is going to be a beast to deal with because the black buttons (on black background) are so small and the text on them not even white that they can barely be read, even with my good eyes",0
6135,"The buttons don't depress either, and the disabled buttons look almost identical to enabled buttons",0
6136,"Combined with the sluggish interface, you can't really tell if clicking is doing anything",-1
6137,Worse still is the search,-1
6138,The designers apparently felt that having a stack of magazines in front of you is the ideal interface because this search stinks,0
6139,Trying to locate a map of mountains of Greece turned up a small result set of articles that had nothing to do with either Greece or mountains,0
6140,But the biggest insult is the scan quality,-1
6141,"This is where you really had to stand back and say, yes, this is truly an amateur job",0
6142,"Scans are not color adjusted, scanner artifacts are rife and they apparently decided not to scan high and then downsample",0
6143,"As a result the text is hard to read, and their stupid enhance text feature (to make up for the poor scanning job) doesn't help a whole lot",0
6144,This was basically wasted money because it's so difficult to use,-1
6145,I've heard NG did a much worse job with earlier versions so I guess they are improving,0
6146,They are still a long way off from having a good product though,1
6147,Outside of the challange of getting it on the hard drive for a complete install once you get it there it is a fantastic source of info,0
6148,Great product,1
6149,The content in this collection is worth countless hours of entertainment and virtual adventures,1
6150,For this I would give it 10/5 stars if possible,1
6151,Even seeing the old ads is like traveling back in time and laughs are guaranteed,1
6152,What I find really upsetting is that such little effort was put into producing a quality delivery platform,-1
6153,I am a software engineer myself and I cannot fathom releasing such a clunky interface,-1
6154,"The menus transitions are slow, the options limited, and even the new feature for PCs to copy the DVD content onto the hard disk is questionable",-1
6155,"No user should have to go through the detailed manual steps involved, even if they are properly specified",0
6156,Modern software should live by higher usability and convenience standards,1
6157,"Finally, the trivia game is nothing more than a series of multiple choice questions with no motivation for improvement",0
6158,"Microsoft Encarta's trivia game was released more than 10 years ago and is still plenty of fun!

Come on NG! Your content is way too awesome to be presented so poorly!",1
6159,Neat Idea - Kind Of Like Having A National Geographic Enclycopedia At Your Fingertips - Ads And Pictures Of Products From By Gone Years Bring Back Fond Memories - I Never Expected To Have An Opportunity To Again See Early 1900's Editions Remembered From Visits To Grammas House - Excellent Value & Investment!,0
6160,The information contained and having all pages of the National Geographic is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone,1
6161,The Big disappointment comes from the interface used to display the magazine,-1
6162,1) slow - Distractingly so slow that each page turn is excruciatingly painful and it makes me wonder will i ever get there,-1
6163,2) Photographed PDF images instead of text,0
6164,"- this is a huge pain on an entirely new level!!!
3) Text is not searchable because of the PDF images
4) Photographs become pixelated when zooming because of the PDF images
5) Text is near impossible to read with out being fatigued because of the old source text",-1
6165,6) Zooming in is difficult to do and exploring the page is another exercise in frustration,-1
6166,This software could be improved by providing just the pages in PDF form without the stupid software,-1
6167,The software developers could have ran the magazine through google OCR to extract the text or use higher resolution photos,0
6168,Taking the time to extract the images is a necessity!!!,0
6169,I was pleasantly surprised to see the depth of information found on the DVD's,1
6170,The details of the graphs and  the photographs were beautiful,1
6171,The table of contents was simple to use,1
6172,"I have the earlier CD-ROM version of The Complete National Geographic, and was attracted because this one is not only more up to date but takes up far less space",0
6173,Surprisingly it is not so good,-1
6174,It takes an interminable time to load,0
6175,"Not only is it much harder to use ""SEARCH"" but it lacks the facility to rotate pages",-1
6176,"The National Geographic throughout its history has printed many of its pictures sideways on the page, and so if you use a desktop, they are extremely dificult to see properly unless you are athletic enough to turn your head to be horizontal to the floor",0
6177,All right with a laptop because it's easier to rotate the whole thing,0
6178,But what a crazy omission,0
6179,I found that one entire issue in the 1950s has been reproduced twice and defied the index,0
6180,"I wrote to the NGM customer help people but they said I was mistaken, and when I wrote back saying that I was not I heard nothing further",0
6181,"So, regard this product as a beta minus, and hope that thay can do better in the future",0
6182,"For someone who is a huge History/Geography buff, this item is a surefire winner of a gift",0
6183,These design guys seems to pay much of the attention to protect their intellectual property rather than to improve user experience,0
6184,They scan these issues into spectral format which can only be opened by their program,0
6185,You have to insert DVD to read any part of the magazines,0
6186,"There is no way you can copy the contents on to your hard disk, which makes the reading quite inconvenient",0
6187,You have to resale the page size each time you turn to a new page,0
6188,The turning between pages is also slow and involve noisy disc reading,0
6189,It seems that they want you to read as few times as possible,0
6190,I believe that many of the bad reviews were before the update that National Geographic did,0
6191,"This is truly a wealth of information, and quite remarkable software",1
6192,My copy installed flawlessly onto my hard drive,0
6193,"If you're wondering if this will work for you or not, here's what I think you need:

1)  A decent computer-- If your computer can be found on on an advertisement in National Geographic from the 80s or 90s, this software probably won't run too smoothly on your system",0
6194,So don't say that these CDs suck if your computer once survived Y2K,0
6195,2)  Follow the instructions --([,0
6196,"] )Their website tell you to insert disc 1, then go to preferences and update the software",0
6197,After doing that there is a button that says to install it to the hard drive,0
6198,"It lets you choose where you want to install it, and after about 5-7 hours with vigilance to swap out the discs (real time depend on your computer), your software will be installed",0
6199,No tricks involved if you just update the software from the start,0
6200,Very easy,1
6201,"3)  I expected there to be at least three things, but there's not",0
6202,It's quite simple,1
6203,I am overwhelmingly satisfied with this purchase,1
6204,"I wish I could take a few days off just to catch up on some National Geographic reading, but instead I will enjoy the sparse moments with this software at random times over times over the next several years",0
6205,"This would make for a great gift, a great resource, a great hobby if you had all day to read",1
6206,Negatives:  The only thing that would make this better in my opinion is if they could have some sort of side scroller that would show the different pages (smaller) so that you wouldn't have to clink each page one by one just to see what's on it,-1
6207,"Also, they need to solve the problem with the pages that need to be rotated 90 degrees to see the content",0
6208,"**Bonus tip:  Many people have mentioned that you cannot get the images directly from the articles, however, if you have Vista or Windows 7 this problem is solved with the ""snipping tool""",0
6209,Very easy to grab images if you would ever need to,1
6210,This is great I love National Geo,1
6211,and to have the past issues is great,1
6212,"The platform was not fully developed, they rushed it to put it out for Christmas, but the updates are free so not bad",2
6213,overall great buy!!!,1
6214,One word says it all--Marvelous!  To have this much history in such an accessible form is almost beyond belief for a long-time fan of the Geographic,0
6215,'Nuf said!,0
6216,I've spent over a week of my time and have finally installed the content on my hard drive,0
6217,I have a Win7 machine with 4GB of memory and a Core 2 Duo at about 2 GHz,0
6218,Copying the content took 2-3 hours PER DVD (there are 6),0
6219,"I would advise going to the National Geographic website (CNG support page) and reading the posts, and very carefully following their procedure",0
6220,I had to install/uninstall several times,0
6221,"I'm happy with the installed product, but the process was painful, and needs to be improved",1
6222,Amazing! If you are a Nat Geo fan these discs are soooo cool! Highly recommend!,1
6223,6 DVDs that go back to the Start of the Magazine,0
6224,"eighteeen hundreds,with a two tone cover and few picture to begin with",0
6225,(Mostly line drawings early on,0
6226,)The Magazines and Articles take you all the way from back then to the End of 2008,0
6227,"every cover, every article every ad",0
6228,"For me it is interesting seeing how things were in the past, and  what my parents and Uncles and Aunts  went through during the era of WW2, The Depression etc",0
6229,I always have admired NGeo for their articles and vivid photography coupled with an interest in almost every field of exploration and science,0
6230,So if your thinking about buying this set or for a gift,0
6231,its a winner from top to bottom,0
6232,The set is only made active after some On line verafication,0
6233,then it is uniquie to that one computer and owner,0
6234,to protect their interests in the software,0
6235,so you cant run it off other computers unless you buy another complete set,0
6236,OVer all its awesome,1
6237,Buy it,1
6238,As an owner of Complete National Geographic 109 years 31 cd rom this attempted improvement is a complete BUST,0
6239,"I own it but cannot use it as specified in the operating instructions which I have into<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-National-Geographic-Every-Issue-Since-1888/dp/1426296355/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete National Geographic- Every Issue Since 1888</a>&nbsp;booklet form",0
6240,"I cannot download upgrades, I cannot see the screens as depicted in the booklet",0
6241,I constantly receive or download an AIR operating system that has not been damaged,0
6242,"Therfore, I shall never be able to use this theoretical upgrade",0
6243,"I have used the cds for years with great satisfaction and if I can find a buyer at the Senior Center for this new piece of Junk, I shall sell it at the drop of a hat",0
6244,"I would highly recommend the purchase of this collection to anyone who is REALLY into collecting
the National Geographic Magazine as this really compliments the collection in case you are
missing any issues it helps complete and compliment your grand collection and makes it handy to
do research or lookups on certain life's events and studies of earth's peoples and creatures",1
6245,"I strongly recommend this purchase it is a must have!! This was a gift for the family and home
library and what a wonderful and educational addition it is! :o) Just go for it",1
6246,The software arrived in a timely manner with no difficulties in getting it,0
6247,The user interface looks very flashy but is somewhat confusing to actually use,-1
6248,The Complete National Geographic has a lot of potential - BUT trying to install the content on the hard drive is close to impossible,0
6249,The basic install is easy but requires you to flip DVD's whenever you want to see anything,1
6250,The software advertises itself as being capable of installing the content to a hard drive - BUT actually doing it is very challenging,0
6251,After a half a dozen attempts and reading multiple discussions on the subject I was finally able to copy the content to the hard drive,0
6252,"HOWEVER, copying each of the 6 DVD's took 2-4 hours",0
6253,So don't expect this to be up and running for your homework tomorrow,0
6254,This set was purchased for my son who is a National Geo junkie,0
6255,He absolutely loves this,1
6256,"You can read every article, view pictures, maps, etc",0
6257,We were amazed that you could also read all the old advertisements that were in the magazines,1
6258,I would highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys National Geographic magazines,1
6259,"Recommendation: BUY IT!!!! I used them for a couple of searches and was pleased to give them, to my teacher daughter, for great Christmas gift",1
6260,Great product,1
6261,Works well on my mac,1
6262,I love ng and now I have all the magazines scone the start,1
6263,"I have purchased two sets of these DVDs: the first when it originally came out, and the second just recently (January 2010)",0
6264,I installed the programs that allow the magazine images to be seen,0
6265,"So, I would like to give future buyers this bit of advice",1
6266,"This set of DVDs look gorgeous and will please you if and only if:

You have a relatively new, and relatively powerful PC (that is fast and has a lot of RAM memory)",0
6267,"I first attempted to install this DVD set's software on an older desktop (HP a452n with a 32-bit, Intel Pentium 4) PC that uses Windows XP",0
6268,"On a machine of this vintage, the software would not load correctly or function at all",0
6269,"While the software's manual says that it will work with Windows XP, please be skeptical",1
6270,"However, it installed properly and easily on my newest desktop PC, an (Hp Pavilion n9340f with a 64-bit, Intel Quad-core CPU) which uses Window Vista (64-bit version)",0
6271,Unfortunately much software is written with the fastest hardware in mind,-1
6272,I not saying that it will not work with less powerful machines,0
6273,I am simply reminding you that the older your machine is (and therefore less powerful) the more likely you are to be displeased with this otherwise excellent product,0
6274,This version of Complete Nation Geographic is vastly improved over the original set,0
6275,The most important thing is the viewability of the scanned pages and this set does not disappoint,0
6276,"The original version left much to be desired, but these newly scanned images are bright and tack sharp",0
6277,I appreciated that you could zoom in up to 2X and the text or photo stayed sharp,1
6278,Indicative of high quality scans,0
6279,The earlier set consisted of 30 CDs and you were constantly swapping them in and out,0
6280,This new version has been condensed to 6 DVDs,0
6281,"Even better, you can copy the DVDs to your hard drive and cruise from 1888 to 2008 without touching a disc",0
6282,Nice touches are the inclusion of a search feature and a very handy bookmarking tool,1
6283,Another nice touch is the ability to print a single page or double page spread,1
6284,"As other reviewers have pointed out, there is one flaw in an otherwise superb set",0
6285,And that is the omission of a rotation feature,0
6286,Many pictures were printed across the page and difficult to see,0
6287,"You can always print the page, or turn your head but this should have never happened",0
6288,"National Geographic says a fix is on the ways, but as of 1/24/10, not yet",0
6289,"Even with the rotation glitch, the overall quality and enjoyment merit a five star rating",1
6290,"This is 100% better than the earlier version, much more user friendly and the page quality is far far better",1
6291,"The ability to copy the whole thing to your HD make life so much easier and a lot quicker, no more changing disks",0
6292,Overall I would recommend this to anyone who loves the National Geographic magazine,1
6293,National Geographic has accomplished the difficult task of presenting 110 years of magazines with a single interface in spite of the fact the source documents and formats have vastly improved over the years,0
6294,"Their web site now shows how to install and run the system from any user external USB drive (you do not need to buy theirs), improving speed and convenience to a point the interface is a pleasure to use",0
6295,"This review is primarily about the software, not the content",0
6296,I have updated the software to whatever was available as of this writing (3/29/2010),0
6297,The software seems more like a beta version than a production-ready version,0
6298,I've been kicked out a few times and it otherwise locks up periodically,0
6299,I am running off the DVDs; I have not copied any of the disks to my hard drive,0
6300,"Consequently, moving from page to page is slow",-1
6301,Trying to back up to refer to a map or recall a fact is not something you want to do,0
6302,Lock ups occur when trying to quickly scoot past several pages,0
6303,"Even if paging were fast, there are other problems",0
6304,I expect there to be a class action lawsuit against NG owing to the mass outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome that is inevitable,0
6305,"The text is unreadably small as presented, so I double-click twice ON EACH AND EVERY 2-PAGE sheet to magnify the text so I can read it",0
6306,"Then I must click and drag each page 2 or 3 times to move from top to bottom, and then a few more times to move to the top of the next column; the mouse scroll wheel is not active",0
6307,A few book marks have thrown me to the magazine cover rather than to the desired page,0
6308,"As I progress through an issue, I have to create a new book mark at each stopping point as there is no quick way to reset an existing book mark",0
6309,"If you are accustomed to an eReader like Kindle, the whole interface will seem like two steps backward",0
6310,"If this software is your first foray into reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer, then you will think that a computer is not suitable for reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer",0
6311,"For reference reading, the absence of any way to copy text from the page, or add notes to the text, makes this a poor reference tool",0
6312,My lone comment on the content stems from my attempt to begin reading from the very first issue,0
6313,"Basically, it seems that you'd better be a geologist or physiographer (term from text) to enjoy the early issues as even the first issue is thick with geo-jargon",0
6314,I am now working from 2006 backwards,0
6315,It is nice to have the whole collection compact and handy,1
6316,There is some instability,1
6317,Vista has crashed a couple of times,0
6318,National Geographic is one of the items that is part of the fabric of our lives,0
6319,"Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child",0
6320,"Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed",0
6321,Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases,0
6322,"This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box",0
6323,"Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover",0
6324,All the maps are here too,0
6325,The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today,0
6326,This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world,0
6327,I am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems,0
6328,Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues,1
6329,A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary,0
6330,Photo quality varies over time,0
6331,The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great,-1
6332,You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image,0
6333,The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either,2
6334,I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this,0
6335,There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported,1
6336,Is it worth it?  That depends on you,0
6337,"Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?  When was the last time you bought an icebox or considered buying a Cord?  If you can answer yes to these questions, this set will provide all the opportunities to do these things you can wish for",0
6338,Does not get 5 stars because the program user interface is not well design,2
6339,But once you get the content in an external hard drive is lots of fun searching and viewing pages of the entire magazine collection,0
6340,Here are the proper instructions to put on an external hard drive as a fresh installation,0
6341,READ HERE - The EASY WAY to use the DVDs in an external hard drive configuration,1
6342,This works for both OS X Leopard and Windows 7 (should also work on Window XP but need to be tested),0
6343,Step 1 - Before any installation Copy the entire content of all the DVDs to the root (i,0
6344,D:\) of the external drive,0
6345,"You will end up with the installation programs, other files, and the six folder with the content (Disk1 to Disk6)",0
6346,Note:  copying them in a subdirectory instead that the bottom level (root level) does not work,0
6347,Step 2 - run the installation program from the external drive (this is key),0
6348,Step 3 - open the program and click ok when it asks to insert Disk 1,0
6349,"The program will look for disk 1 on the drive that was installed from, the external drive, and will find all others automatically",0
6350,NOTE: If you had already install the program from the DVD before reading this uninstall the program using the uninstaller and manually delete the Data folder and all its content,0
6351,"The data folder name starts with ""com",0
6352,"nationalgeographic"" for all platform",0

6369,Good evening to all readers of National Geographic,0
6370,I rate this product the full five stars because it is the only collection of all 120 years of Nat Geo available on web or library,0
6371,"Lets be fair, to own this much pure access for only $60 is a five star deal!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought mine at Best Buy for $59 and was told no returns on software, only an exchange",0
6372,The many user comments are all true with reference to the lack of software sophistication,0
6373,You need to have the necessary windows file knowledge to make the DVD's part of the hard drive at a generous 50GB of space,0
6374,Several commenters refer to the Nat Geo FAQ page and this resource will give you the tools for a full integrated hard drive load,0
6375,My experience started with a twice crashed disk load,0
6376,"I had to uninstall it twice, change the update settings on the disk and the third time I was successful",0
6377,To load the six DVD disks took over twelve hours with the last several disks taking the longest at several hours each,0
6378,"I have a 38"" LED monitor in tandem with three more 23"" monitors on my primary computer system",0
6379,I do a great deal of computer and mathematics as a profession and will not simply give up on a software application because it is currently buggy,2
6380,Do not give up either as this review states that the final product is worth five stars and Adobe Air will fix or improve all current software needs with a few more releases,0
6381,"Having used the product extensively, it will stop responding in short time if you click on too many requests for page info without giving it time to load and move forward to the next request",1
6382,I have a dual quad core system and it is the software as opposed to the hardware that is requiring Adobe to create a larger cache memory ratio for user throughput of info per page,0
6383,"It is pleasure to read the articles and use the google gadgets translator, currency converter and of course wikipedia to make sense out of the depth of content that is the hallmark of Nat Geo",0
6384,"Improvements would be a non sophisticated and bullet proof loading of disks to hard drive, a right click fuctionality to Explorer accelerators and an efficent transfer to Microsoft OneNote for those who want to write reports and summaries of a search",0
6385,I hope Adobe will incorporate these requests in the future and I will continue to check for the updates in the product start screen,0
6386,"I recommend the larger over 30"" screen for viewing the wide pages",0
6387,I have not experienced a sideways picture yet and this may be a simple solution,0
6388,Large monitors are not expensive and the double magnify and Lupe feature give deep detail to many of the pictures,0
6389,Good night and sweet Nat Geo dreams!,0
6390,"The content of National Geographic is beyond reproach, so I'm not criticizing that; but the DVD version is frustrating to load and use",-1
6391,"Despite ""patches"" and other schemes to download the DVDs on my hard drive, it works on neither my Mac nor my PC",0
6392,"I spent almost an entire day on this problem before writing this review, following printed directions to the letter and consulting with folks at Mac and National Geographic, the latter of which offers NO customer support",0
6393,"Since purchased it from Amazon and not the NG website, NG referreed me back to Amazon which, of course, I didn't bother to call",0
6394,"NG magazine connected me to someone who barely spoke English, who gave me a phone number that didn't work",0
6395,Now that's customer support,0
6396,"The product will work if I want to carry around a handful of DVDs, but it cannot be loaded onto my hard drive, and I don't want to switch DVDs back and forth to do some research",0
6397,"Besides, it's awkward to use and painstakingly slow",-1
6398,"I've downloaded several magazine archives without a problem, but not NG",0
6399,So back it goes to Amazon,0
6400,I received this as a Christmas gift and love it,1
6401,"Like many other reviewers, I purchased the earlier version and was so disappointed that I ended up throwing the CDs away",-1
6402,This newer product is wonderful,1
6403,"It took a little clicking around to figure out the interface, but after that I was absorbed in reading the great articles",1
6404,"I really like the bookmark feature and ""geobrowse"" which allows you to find articles about a specific location",1
6405,"The interface could be modified to make actions more apparent and quicker, but I have had no real issue in navigating or searching articles",1
6406,A rotate option would have been a nice feature,0
6407,"The image quality, especially with the newer issues, is amazing",1
6408,"I read the articles on a 17-inch screen and do not have to magnify to clearly see the text (except on some of the early, 1888-89, articles)",0
6409,I think any fan of National Geographic magazine would enjoy receiving this,0
6410,Pros: contains every page of every issue since the birth of this great magazine until 2009,1
6411,"Not just the texts, but photos, and even advertisements (granted that earlier issues from 1880's were free of photos)",0
6412,It will take you a long time to read them all,0
6413,"All for a reasonable price of ~$70

Cons:

1",0
6414,"The curse of software is that as soon as it comes out, it is obsolete",0
6415,"And in the case of the CNG, regular updates only improves the software, but not the data because it ends in 2008",0
6416,It remains unknown if they will release incremental additional discs that start in 2009,0
6417,"More often than not, companies release only the complete version that always starts from the beginning, frustrating early collectors",0
6418,"But we won't know the answer until at lease a decade later, and by then, DVDs are probably no more useful than 8-tracks",0
6419,2,0
6420,NGM is known for its awesome photos,1
6421,"However, in the digital version, all pages are scanned with sub-par qualities",0
6422,"When viewed at 100%, there are annoying artifacts around texts and the photos are posterized",0
6423,"Also the resolution is too low, especially on these map inserts, small fonts are almost unintelligible",0
6425,"Every page is a picture, making it impossible to copy and paste, and thus you will have to live with the compression artifacts, and are unable to do things like copying and pasting to a word processor to view it with real fonts",0
6427,The software framework is not every intuitive,-1
6428,"It has a lot of features, but no documentation on how to use them",0
6429,"So all I do is browse by year/browse issues and read each issue from the first page to the last, just like I do a real magazine",0
6431,The software is poorly built,-1
6432,The software frequently screws up,-1
6433,"When you switch from one issue to another, it frequently fails to load the new one and shows a blank screen",0
6434,You will have to restart the software,0
6435,"So it could've been done better, and I would be more than happy to pay double the price if they doubled the resolution and the number of discs",0
6436,"But for $70, it is still well worth it",-1
6437,"I purchased this as a gift for my father, who has subscribed to the print edition of National Geographic for over 20 years",0
6438,Looks very nice in it's box,1
6439,Very easy to use for skimming through random issues,1
6440,A little more time-comsuming if you're looking for a specific topic and trying to use the index,0
6441,We got the Complete National Geographic as a Christmas gift for our son,0
6442,He's thrilled with it,1
6443,This is what should come preloaded on every computer,0
6444,Just time warping through the history of more then a century from National Geographic's perspective has got me a little geeking out,0
6445,The photos alone make this a worthy addition,0
6446,I put this problem in the separate chat section so I would know if anyone can help on this,0
6447,Frankly I am surprised that it is not covered in the NG installation guidance,0
6448,In a nutshell I need CNG and Maps NG on an external HDD so I can use both with any one of my three PCs,0
6449,"I hope someone will be able to help on this:

I want these two sets on an external hard drive so I can take them with me on trips",0
6450,CDs are not the way to pack for an airplane/train trip therefore I got the big hard drive and now I need to install all the discs,0
6451,I did install many - #7 Complete disk was blank,0
6452,"Problem, both Maps and Complete don't want to wake up",0
6453,The HDD will be used with Win7 laptop and netbook and XP desktop,0
6454,Any suggestions? I get NO responses from National Geographic in a month of emails every few days,0
6456,This is an amazing collection of every National Geographic magazine - page by page,1
6457,Fantastic!,1
6458,"I love flipping through the pages of National Geographic, although not all the subjects covered interest me",1
6459,I received this set and am really impressed with the product,1
6460,The collection is great because of the enormous amount of content I can flip through as many issues as I could ever want,1
6461,The price on Amazon was also very reasonable for 120 years of magazine content,0
6462,"The installation was easy, the software has seen several updates (which tells me they are paying attention to the comments here and elsewhere), and there has been a promise of future updates to add additional content as the years go by",1
6463,If they follow through on that it will be even more wonderful,1
6464,There is also a way to load the DVDs onto your hard drive so you don't need to constantly be swapping them,0
6465,There is a review here that has a comment linking to the product FAQ where instructions can be found,0
6466,As of this writing there is no automatic way for Windows users to do this,0
6467,Adding this functionality as a part of the included program would give this program 5 stars,1
6468,"Brilliant - Easy to install, and use",1
6469,The search feature is brilliant,1
6470,No more looking thru stacks of magasines to find the article you need,0
6471,Gave this as a Christmas gift to our adult son who's science oriented,0
6472,It has everything you could imagine so the file sizes are huge,0
6473,"If you have an older machine, it will take a while to load the cd's (6) but you only use 2-6 to research material",0
6474,You can print articles that appear but many things need exploring at this point,0
6475,It appears to be a good value,1
6476,I write few reviews,0
6477,"If a product works and meets my expectations, I find it isn't necessary to bore people with the details or laud the product",1
6478,"I bought this for my 86 year old mother-in-law, who has read NG since childhood",0
6479,"She was tickled pink at the thought of being able to read them again, see the pictures, etc",1
6480,from her childhood,0
6481,"She is quite computer savvy, as am I",1
6482,"However she cannot get this DVD to load, despite her attempts and mine to follow all of the complicated and convoluted instructions on NGs website regarding the MANY issues with the flawed installation program they placed on this DVD collection",1
6483,"I have emailed NG customer service 3 times, an d it took them a week to respond",1
6484,I simply wish to know if they can send my MIL a disc with the new installation program on it,0
6485,"Otherwise, we'll be forced to return this product to Amazon and wait until such time as they come out with a new edition that isn't flawed",0
6486,Edit - NG is working with the MIL to try and get things up and running - will update if/when it works,0
6487,UPDATE - MIL got it working with the help of the NG people - the lady who helped her out spent a lot of time and was very patient with my MIL helping her,1
6488,"MIL is now THRILLED with the product and says it is very ""awesome"" :)",1
6489,I was very pleased with my order and how easy it was to order and receive it,1
6490,"I must say that my excitement upon seeing this product, and its pricetag, was such that my wife didn't even bother arguing with me when I told her that I must get this",0
6491,"After I have received it, well, I'm still happy that I own it, but it has been somewhat disappointing",2
6492,"Instead of rambling, I'll just write it in bullet form, disappointments first:
1",-1
6494,"19, 2009, no HDD install
It's quite slow, and having it read from the DVD compounds this",-1
6495,"The only way around it is to copy them on your user-specific folder, which means that if you use a computer with more than one account, you'll need 50GBs of space per user if you want all of them to access it from the HDD",0
6496,"The more tedious solution is to copy all the images on your harddrive and use a virtual DVD to load all the discs, but that is still awkward",0
6498,"Slow
I can understand if the images are slow to load, or if the queries are slow due to the vast data, but I just don't understand why the geographic browser is slow on a computer that has more than one CPU",0
6500,"Picture quality
I understand the reasoning behind loading not-so-great pictures in order to prevent some from using them outright, but the quality is hideous to somebody who enjoys photography",0
6501,"It's nothing like something you'd expect in this decade - you can see jagged edges, jumps in tone, and everything else that screams that quality has been compromised for storage",0
6502,"I would've been perfectly happy with pictures that they put on the web, resized so that it won't be usable outside of the computer, but the pics look as if they were scanned 10 years ago",1
6503,"Well, that's about it for disappointments, but #1 is a big big big disappointment since it's advertised as if it can be loaded to your HDD, and NG isn't the same if it doesn't have absolutely stunning pictures",-1
6504,"As for the often mentioned type size in articles, if you have a 24-inch monitor, it's not a problem at all",0
6505,"On my 24 inch LCD, the articles are slightly larger than lifesize when viewed full screen, and it's perfectly readable without any magnification",0
6506,"Pictures, on the other hand, are awkward - let's just say that the bonus DVD has better still shots than the scanned pictures inside",0
6507,"Still, it's nice to have 120 years worth of NG at your grasp, complete with ads and pictures, and able to search it for articles or even pictures, if you can remember at least part of its caption",0
6508,"Great product, but it really needs to be upgraded with the capability to rotate individual pages 90 degrees for better viewing when the page contains horizontal material, such as full-page illustrations",0
6509,There's so much history in here,0
6510,"120 years, in a package you can hold in your hands, complete with photographs, advertising - everything",0
6511,What a great concept,1
6512,"Yes, it has install issues on Windows 7, the search functions aren't as good as what you find on Google, and as of now, there's no way to keep it updated as new content becomes available",0
6513,"But, with a product like this, the long-term view is what counts - eventually these issues will be worked out, and you get to own a piece of history for something like three cents an issue",0
6514,"Now, if only we could get the same deal from the NY Times",0
6516,"As mentioned in other reviews, in this edition the quality of reading has been much improved",1
6517,"It works under Windows XP ( my previous collection worked only under Windows 98)

You can see all the maps which were edited previouly in another software sold separately",0
6518,"The only problem I mentioned before was that I couldn't print this edition, like many buyers",0
6519,"From today, this technical problem has been solved : NGS has sent us an Adobe Air update and now we have no more blank pages on the preview of the printing software machine",0
6520,And really it works on paper,0
6521,"With this update, you can also now rotate the old pages of the magazine like on a PDF software, which was not possible when the product was released",0
6522,"Thanks NGS for these technical improvements, even if it took one year of complaint before they were achieved !

Now everybody can buy the CNG safely for reading and printing",0
6523,"This evening (13th of June 2011), I could at last buy and download the 2009 and 2010 complete updates, which were not previously available for customers outside USA and Canada",0
6524,So thanks again NGS for solving this problem,1
6525,I now have the complete 1888-2010 years installed on the hard drive of my computer,0
6526,"Nevertheless, when I compare, the paper edition is more glamorous than the computer one, but it takes a lot of space to keep it in my small flat in Paris ( I own all the July 1946 until May 2011 paper issues of the NGM)",0
6527,I finally listened to one of the reviewers and was able to copy all the DVD's to my hard drive & that makes it a lot easier to search rather than swapping out 6 DVD's,0
6528,Instructions are now on National Geographics site at [,0
6529,] Warning it took me about 2+ hours for each DVD,0
6530,This is a great product that has the complete contents of all 120 years of National Geographic in one place,1
6531,"No need to save all those copies in your basement, put them on your hard drive",0
6532,"The search function works fine, my only complaint is many of the earlier pictures are sideways with no current way of flipping them, so you need to crimp your neck or forget about looking at that picture",0
6533,Maybe they will fix that in a future update,0
6534,It seems to be more of a problem with the older issues,0
6535,"Contrary to what some people have said the issues are all very readable on my 22"" monitor",0
6536,"For the price of less than 50 $, this is a steal",0
6537,Enough information to be an encyclopedia / atlas in itself,0
6538,The search function is decent enough and lets you quickly read about almost any place,0
6539,The photographs take you back in time,0
6540,Cant read the issues on my netbook since it doesnt have a dvd/cd drive and the disc needs to be present in order to read the articles,0
6541,Software (Adob*-AIR) tries to connect to the internet even though I think I've opted out of updates,0
6542,No way of knowing what information it sends to the Adob* servers - but for most people this may not be an issue,0
6543,All in all a great buy,1
6544,"I've had it since the day before Thanksgiving, and I think it's amazing",1
6545,"It takes a couple days to learn the interface, but from then on it's almost perfect",1
6546,"Don't listen to readability issues, these are people who haven't mastered the magnification feature, which works for articles I've read going back to the 1890's",0
6547,"Once I can load all the DVD's to my hard drive, it will be perfect",1
6548,"Found mine at Costco for $34, and they had a bunch",0
6549,"Colleagues at work, after viewing it in action for 30 seconds, decided it was the Xmas gift their spouse was going to get",0
6550,"All the National Geographics together, and easily searched! I made the 'mistake' of buying direct from NG, but even with a discount it was more than on Amazon",0
6551,I bought this with the intention of being able to read the actual articles,0
6552,"The scans of the pages seem to be optimized for photos, not for text",0
6553,I couldn't stand to read more than a couple of paragraphs of the hazy text,0
6554,"This was even on issues from a few years ago, not the older ones",0
6555,"There is a menu button to sharpen the text, but for the life of me it doesn't seem to do anything",0
6556,I think they put it there to trick you into thinking the text is sharper,0
6557,"I REALLY had high hopes for this, but if you just want to look at the pictures (and there are plenty of great ones) AND you find it for a low price then go for it",1
6558,"i couldn't get the disks to open on vista or windows 7, couldn't get it to copy to any of the hard
drives, went to the NG site and tried to use their installer and updated version of adobe air, and still
couldn't get it to work",0
6559,"heard it was still in beta testing and shouldn't have been released, also some patch
was available as of nov 1 but other still can't get it to work",0
6560,able to get my 60 dollars back from walmart,0
6561,good luck,1
6562,"My husband is a big fan of National Geographic, and you cannot believe the magazines I have tucked away for him",0
6563,"EEEK! I'm running out of space!!!
When I saw this item I nearly fainted: FINALLY I can give him not just the recent issues, but EVERY issue, and I don't have to save all those old magazines",0
6564,"PLUS now he can search for articles of interest, browse the great pix",0
6565,this is a wife's DREAM if she's married to a NG freak!,0
6566,I'm not seeing a way to rotate horizontal photos that are presented vertically,0
6567,I would have thought that would be one of the most important fuctions on the interface,0
6568,If I'm just overlooking the way to do this could someone please tell me how? I sure would appreciate it,0
6569,I was truly amazed to see this definitive collection of all the national geographic issues in 6 DVDs,0
6570,It is a wonderful collection of every issue printed since 1888 upto December 2008,0
6571,"Every printed page, including the advertisements, are there",0
6572,The sacanned pages are of high quality,1
6573,The pictures have the same quality as in the printed magazine,1
6574,"This is a very good product; however, I have given it four stars instead of five because I had a hard time copying all the content to my hard drive",1
6575,"Initially the National Geographic said that they would release an update which will enable users to copy the contents of all six DVDs to their hard drives after November 1st, 2009",0
6576,"However, they have failed to to this to date; instead, they gave some instructions on how to copy the 6 DVDs, which involves a good knowledge of the file system in Windows",0
6577,They gave these instructions just after the Thanksgiving Day; and they said that they will release an update which will enable the users to copy the contents easily without looking into the windows file system,0
6578,"I managed to copy all of my DVDs to my hard drive, however it took me two days to do that: 2-3 hours per DVD",0
6579,"Other than that, this collection is a truly wonderful set; it is a dream come true",1
6580,I hightly recommend it,1
6581,I had every issue of National Geographic since the 1960s but didn't have room for them when I moved so I gave them away  a few years ago,0
6582,I saw that it was available in a set on DVD ROM so I bought it hoping it would be an adequate replacement,0
6583,"While all the content is there, the Adobe Air interface is terrible and is an exercise in frustration to attempt to navigate it",0
6584,"The default page size is too small for me to read the text, so I have to magnify it, but every time you turn the page it resets and you have to magnify it again",0
6585,After turning a few pages the program becomes non responsive and it just hourglasses for half a minute until it finally displays the next page,0
6586,I tried it on my Macintosh as well and had the same results,0
6587,"Thinking it might be slow disk access causing the issue, I used the Mac's built in Disk Utility to create an",0
6588,iso of one of the disks on my hard drive and mounted it as another drive,0
6589,I still had the same slow and non-responsive behavior when it was running as a disk image on the hard drive as it did using the physical disk on both my PC and Mac,0
6590,"Having over a century of content in this collection is great, but the Adobe Air interface to access it is horrible",1
6591,I hope that access time and other features improves when Adobe Air 2,0
6592,0 is released but I don't know if it will or not,0
6593,As of December 2009 there are definitely ways to copy the DVDs to a hard drive so that the DVDs are not required to use the program,0
6594,"If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location",0
6595,"Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk",0
6596,"Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation)",0
6597,"Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!

The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a ""copy everything to disk"" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now",0
6598,The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO,0
6599,This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago,0
6600,"The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor",1
6601,"Our local Costco has had a huge pile of these this holiday season, so I hope this review helps out some of the new purchasers looking for information about the product",0
6602,"If you haven't bought it yet, it's a great deal and an amazing wealth of information and imagery",0
6603,"Issues through (most of?) 2008 are included, and they say there will be an option in 2010 to buy the 2009 issues to add to your existing collection",0
6604,Highly recommended,1
6606,"I'm going to order this, so this review isn't about the main product",0
6607,"One of the things genealogists do is not simply looking up names, birthdates, marriage dates, etc",0
6608,"To add ""color"" to the statistical information and ""bring it alive"", information about the period and locality is also used",0
6609,"What were the contents of a Sears & Roebuck catalog from the late 1880's?

According to one reviewer this package includes the original ads",0
6610,Sample excerpts can be used by genealogists,0
6611,What were my grandparents seeing in magazines when my mom was born in 1923?,0
6612,Buyer beware: Software updates to allow HDD installation are not happening as advertised,0
6613,As of Nov 23 this is still a beta product without full functionality,0
6615,Amy Jill is so good and learned so much,0
6616,Whoever was entertained by a Doctoral lecture series of the Old Testament?  I was,1
6617,"In progress and great - I sure the rest the course will be the same , or better; very good presentation!",0
6618,Amy Levine makes a very convincing argument and justifies her revelations from exact test and verse,0
6619,I recommend that you purchase the complete collection of her works,1
6620,"The Audio Tapes and CD's are
convenient and economical",0
6621,Replay a CD over and over to various audiences if you are in a GROUP discussion,0
6622,It will support your Philosophical Position on the OLD TESTAMENT and its meaning,0
6623,"The Great Courses lectures can be pricey so I was delighted with the availability, condition, price and timely shipping of the set",0
6624,All my expectations were exceeded!  Thank you so much,1
6625,"In order to really understand the Old Testament, it's best to have a professor who is both Jewish Orthodox and understands Hebrew",0
6626,Amy Jill Levine is the one who fits the bill,0
6627,"She does not have an agenda like many preachers due, but teaches this course in a ""Bible History"" and ""Bible as Literature"" approach, you know, ""just the facts Ma'am""!  It was great to have a teacher who can point out that the Greek version of the Old Testament can translate very differently than Hebrew, and then again, the King James version can be very different from the Greek",0
6628,Great course!,1
6629,"interesting, very understandable and easy to go along with reading material of the bible",1
6630,i enjoyed it very very much,1
6631,"An enriching course subject conveyed by a likable, knowledgeable, and bright lady that has absolute command of the subject matter",0
6632,The greatest scholars in the world can read and re-read the bible and always find new things in it,1
6633,Such was the case during the viewing of these discs,0
6634,"They were presented in a very understandable and ""down to earth"" manner by way of the use of easy and simple language and terms",1
6635,We enjoyed them very much and will probably go back to them now and again to review some of the information that is contained in them,1
6636,The presentations are scholarly and well presented by a wonderful lady who is a great presenter,1
6637,"I'm a Seminary graduate and I learned a few new things, as she is very current and on top of her field",0
6638,I highly recommend this for personal use or use in a Church classroom,1
6639,"It is not conservative or liberal, it is straightforward in scholarly terms",0
6640,"She is not trying to sell you on any particular viewpoint, she is trying to inform you of the best and latest knowledge in this field",0
6641,I was hoping to get the DVDs but only got the book,0
6642,"The company had clearly disclosed the fact the buyer might only receive one part, but I forgot the reminder when I placed the order",0
6643,"my fault but watch out, you can't tell what you get for sure",0
6644,"This product was shipped immediately, arrived promptly, and was exactly as advertised",1
6645,An excellent choice of supplier!,1
6646,Professor Ehrman is a very enthusiastic and charismatic speaker and he presents his case with the vigor of a prosecuting attorney,0
6647,He has a lot of information here that probably the average lay person does not know or has not thought about,0
6648,"However, much of it is the same as the information in his course about the Historical Jesus which I had listened to a couple of years ago",0
6649,It is only in the second half that he really got into information I had not heard before,1
6650,"However, that said I do recommend his course to anyone who can look at the subject with an open mind and not get upset that his arguements might shake the blind faith that some people go through their lives with",1
6651,I myself prefer knowing exactly what is verifiable of the gospels and how much is tradition that grew up since they were written and I feel that Mr,0
6652,Ehrman has added greatly to my store of knowledge,0
6653,"If you want a ""no punches pulled"" Bible study, then this is for you",0
6654,Professor Ehrman leaves no stone unturned as he explores the history and context in which the books of the New Testament were written,0
6655,"While this study is not for people who do not want their paradigm challenged, folks who are open to examination of the scriptures from all angles will love it! It is important for us in the post modern world to confront head-on all the information that is available to us",0
6656,"For folks who understand the transcendence of the divine, this study is no challenge",0
6657,"However, for the more literally minded, you may find this study hard to accept",0
6658,BEWARE!!!  Professor Bart D,-1
6659,Ehrman is NOT a Christian and it is evident that his goal is to discredit the New Testament and Christianity,0
6660,"His most recent book is called Forgery and Counterforgery:The Use of Literary Deceit in Early Christian Polemics, of which he says - ""Arguably the most distinctive feature of the early Christian literature, is the degree to which it was forged",0
6661,""" and ""letters by Peter and Paul in the New Testament--all forgeries",0
6662,"""  The Bible itself warns us to beware of  wolves in sheep's clothing in Matthew 7:15",0
6663,I think it best to steer clear of this anti-Christ curriculum,0
6665,ehrman frankly cannot present a fair lecture,0
6666,"i do not doubt his ""scholarship"" but his presentations seem centered on the so called german scholarship of the past",0
6667,this line of study was i thought discredited in the 1970 era if i remember correctly,0
6669,Ehrman does historical/critical analysis of religion,0
6670,"This is a great lecture but will be rejected by anyone who insists that
the bible be accepted as inerrant",0
6671,"I almost purchased this course until I did some research on the lecturer, Bart D",0
6672,"Ehrman, a self-described agnostic whose work focuses on textual criticism of the New Testament",0
6673,"If you want your faith diminished in the inherency of the Word of God, then this course is for you, for it seems this is the motivation of this non-believing lecturer",0
6674,"If you want to learn some real information about this man-made mythology, then get this course - it's excellent",1
6675,"If you want to preserve your fantasies, then avoid it and stick with the televangelists",0
6676,"I know many people that have purchased this game, with only one complaint: Too hard",0
6677,"It's not too hard if you spend a little time figuring things out, and it is much more fun than the vast majority of games out there",0
6678,"It is also a very popular game online; you can find over 1,000 sites dedicated to 3DMM",1
6679,Rumors of a second version are quickly spreading,1
6680,I CANT WAIT!!! I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone under the age of 13 however,0
6681,This is a cool game,1
6682,"Making movies is thrilling! You can make short films or long action-packed movies! The actors are funny, and you can use props to make almost anything",0
6683,But be sure to find the pages for the talent book! 3-D Movie Maker=Fun!,0
6684,I do a church newsletter and was using this software until my cd drive ate it,0
6685,I had been looking and looking and even tried Broderbund but couldn't find it there,0
6686,"Then one day while browsing, I came across it here at Amazon",0
6687,THANK GOD!!!  Now I am able find those clipart images I used before,1
6688,I noticed that a previous reviewer said she was running Windows XP Pro and wasn't able to use the program,0
6689,I too am running Windows XP Pro and have no problem opening the images I want to use,0
6690,"When I am searching for a particular image, I open the directory in Windows Picture/Fax Viewer and have no problem finding the image I need",0
6691,"Also, the cd includes a copy of the manual which explains the program as well as a program that allows you to view and print a catalog of the files on the 2 discs",0
6692,Very good program,1
6693,I would recommend it to anyone looking for good religious clip,1
6694,I purchased this product without checking it's compatability to Windows Vista,0
6695,I learned an exspensive lesson,0
6696,I am sure the product is good because I had iot before a long time ago,1
6697,Unfortunately it is doing me no good now,0
6698,This is very good clipart that I use almost every week in my church school lessons,1
6699,It would be hard to live without it!,0
6700,The Print Shop software pulled up an error and would not load,0
6701,The versions are old on the other software,0
6702,very basic clip art and graphics,0
6703,Sorry I bought,0
6704,it's sitting in a corner on my desk,0
6705,I was very disappointed in this software program,-1
6706,I found it to be very poor quality and not as advertised on the website,0
6707,My computer operates with Windows XP Professional,0
6708,"This software does not allow me to access many of the applications, because they only work with earlier versions of Windows",-1
6709,I would not recommend this product to anyone and would like to obtain a refund if possible,1
6710,I agree that this is great software to use in a church office,1
6711,I used it a great deal at my old job (church secretary),1
6712,I liked it so much that I ordered it when I started at a new church,0
6713,I just received it and was really disappointed that it didn't come with a print out of the images,-1
6714,"Where I was using it before a book came with it, so that you could find the image and then go right to it, without having to browse through 2 discs to find the perfect image, especially since there is no search engine",0
6715,I tried to contact Broderbund but since I ordered it at Amazon they will not support it,0
6716,"I finally got through to a human at Broderbund to see if I could at least purchase a book to go with it, I was told that ""the item is discontinued and we do not support it""",0
6717,No matter what I asked he just kept repeating that same sentence,0
6718,I told him that I had just bought it and he just repeated himself,0
6719,I love the product but hate the attitude,1
6720,"Hopefully when you order this you will never need customer or technical support with it, or expect any books or manuels",0
6721,The box just contains the discs and a booklet on how to install the Christian Graphics software,0
6722,"There is nothing included about the ""PrintShop"" or the ""Calendar Creator"", you are totally on your own with these",0
6723,BRODERBUND (THE LEARNING CO) MADE A HUGE MISTAKE WHEN THEY DIS-CONTINUED THIS PRODUCT,0
6724,CLICK-ART THAT IS TRUE TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH IS DIFFICULT TO FIND,0
6725,BRODERBUND  (THE LEARNING CO) SHOULD TAKE THE TIME (AND MONEY) TO MARKET THIS IMPORTANT SOFTWARE TO CHURCHES ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES,0
6726,I DON;T THINK THEY RECOGNIZE A GOOD THING WHEN THEY HAVE IT IN THE PALM OF THEIR HANDS,0
6727,"This is a great clip art program, and you get the extra calendar software and printing software too",1
6728,I use the clip art to illustrate bible stories,0
6729,They have great pictures of all the major stories in the bible which can be printed out onto card stock and used for felt board stories,1
6730,The pictures are bright and colorful and the kids adore them,0
6731,There are also plenty of traditional pictures which are great for adults and older teens,0
6732,"Most of the stories have black and white pictues too, which can be copied for the kids to color before or after the lesson",0
6733,"I love having the coloring pages match the art work used for the felt board, it seems very professional, but is as easy as hitting the print button",1
6734,Passed the AANP family nurse practitioner boards on the first attempt,0
6735,I highly recommend this product,1
6737,Fitzgerald has a remarkable way of explaining the content,1
6738,The CDs are really informative,0
6739,I have already used some of the information learned on the first 3 disks to assist in my exam prep for next year,0
6740,I feel that the CDs really help direct your area's of study and give great insite as to what the test will be like,0
6741,Excellent review,1
6742,I am listening to them in my car or at home - she has a way of getting you to remember the important material in a logical way,0
6743,I'm at a loss to understand the gushing reviews for this distro,0
6744,"On the positive side, it did work fine with my IDE internal floppy drive",0
6745,"It can read, write, and format diskettes",0
6746,MEPIS linux can only read,0
6747,It could work with my PCI internal hardware controlled modem by manually configuring it to ttyS1,0
6748,At least it could do that logged in as root,0
6749,"Logged in as user, by default there is no permission to use the modem",0
6750,It takes command line instructions to give it permission to work,0
6751,I have not seen that before,0
6752,SuSE 8,0
6753,2 didn't do that,0
6754,At least it's better than Ubuntu,0
6755,"For all the gushing about Ubuntu, I have not seen anyone mention its total failure to work with a PCI modem",0
6756,For this much money one might expect support for 3D graphics with Nvidia cards would be bundled in,0
6757,It isn't,0
6758,I might consider giving it 3 stars if it were cheaper,0
6759,Part of the justification for the price is the instruction manual,0
6760,The instruction manual fails to address the problems,0
6761,"Hi,

I want to buy this from AMAZON but I want to be sure that this is the official DVD version that NOVELL sales from their website",0
6762,"Is there a difference between this one and the one from NOVELL online store???

I ask because here is less expensive than NOVELL online store",0
6763,"Will I get the same support?? the same media???

Thank you",1
6764,"A long time unix fan, I found SuSE 10",0
6765,1 to be a pleasant surprise,0
6766,"While the Novell Enterprise product, based on the SuSE 10",0
6767,"1 code base, is a bit more polished than SuSE 10",0
6768,"1, it's also more specialized, being divided into a desktop and a server edition",0
6769,"For my money, like SuSE 10",0
6770,1 because it comes equipped with all the tools and features needed to serve either purpose quite nicely,0
6771,"Linux has long been a power in the server room, with unusual flexibility, long uptimes and good performance, but linux vendors such as Novell are finally beginning to bring the power of the open source community to the desktop, and it shows",0
6772,The added polish and attention to detail are making it conceivable for non-experts to begin using a linux desktop for their everyday routine,0
6773,"As has been pointed out, there are some problems with this release - the biggest problem is the update mechanism, which I would describe as broken",0
6774,"Novell is committed to getting it working well, but in the meantime, I find that smart is an excellent replacement for yast",1
6775,"Smart is based on the ideas of the apt package tool, and capably fills the job of installing software packages and keeping the system up to date",0
6776,The other problem I see is the consumption of system resources by the beagle search engine,0
6777,"Again, I am sure this will be sorted out over time, but for now, I find that it's better to remove or disable beagle",0
6778,"Doing so completely removes any pauses or freezes on the systems I've tested, and enables a silky smooth game of ut2004 or quake 3 arena over the internet",0
6779,"One other issue is the app-armor service, which while a good idea, is perhaps a bit restrictive",0
6780,"While it can be adjusted, some may find it easier to simply turn the service off",0
6781,"With those 3 items addressed, SuSE 10",0
6782,"1 is a very capable, pleasant and snappy OS, and would rate 5 stars",0
6783,"The fact that the couple of issues I mentioned must be dealt to get to that blissful state, are the reason I rate it only 4 stars",0
6784,"Bottom line: For an experienced linux user, a great OS for desktop and/or server room",0
6785,"For less experienced users, I'd recommend something without the minor nits I mentioned, e",0
6786,"Linspire, Xandros, or the Novell SLED 10 product instead",0
6787,I've been using linux now for over a year,0
6788,"After countless installations of other distro's, Suse 10",0
6789,1 worked the best!  I have it installed on a Toshiba laptop and everything worked except for the wireless usb,0
6790,Ndiswrapper worked well and fixed that problem,0
6791,"Other than that, Novell has made a fine desktop distro which can also be used as a server",0
6792,Everything is gui based which made it so much easier to administer,0
6793,The other distro's were good as well but Suse was the only one that had the best install/performance,0
6794,"***Warning though *** the Yast software installer was very, very, very slow but after doing some research, SMART is what I use now (that's why I gave it 4 stars not 5)",0
6795,You could download/install it  and then do all of your installs/updates using it and it's super easy to do,0
6796,I recommend Suse 10,1
6797,1 for those that want a distro that works well out of the box and has the support needed to get you out of tight spots!,0
6798,I have never loaded a Linux system and was concerned about my ability to do so,0
6799,I loaded it on a P-2 350 and it went very smoothly,0
6800,It has increased the performance of my PC and I am so happy with it I will be converting my other computer over,1
6801,"Hey - if you want to look at probably one of the nicest desktop environments around - but little else, Novell will sell you six CDs for $59",0
6802,It didn't recognize the network card on my new Thinkpad Z60t (not exactly a marginal computer),0
6803,"They advertised (on the box) ninety-day technical support, except NOT for network support",0
6804,"I got this long, rambling sales pitch from a rep from Novell - very articulate, but dodgy when I complained",0
6805,"Forum after forum, I read about the same problem - network card recognizability and difficulty finding network drivers, installing them, configuring them and when it's all done (if you can reach this level) it may or may not work",0
6806,"It is not as good as previous versions because the patch update

process has been modified and is hard to use now",0
6807,Sometimes it does not work at all,0
6808,"I cannot even think of where I should start, first off Suse will not find my video card for some reason or another",0
6809,"So basically when I try to boot the operating system up, it scrolls some X-windows error and crashes with some mumbo-jumbo",0
6810,"If I wanted to use Dos again, this is it",0
6811,"My monitor is like making loud screeming noises when I get the display to work, like at 200mhz refresh rate and the screen is all weird looking like a carnival side show mirror",0
6812,"Also, the sound is strange, what is up with the glass breaking sound all the time, they talk about Windows having problems geesh!

Now I am at a library using the internet thanks to this, plus it cost money to drive to the public library and they are fixing to close",0
6813,"They got me on this one, next time I will buy a computer with Windows XP at least it will work",0
6814,Hands down the best overall Linux experience you can have,0
6815,"It is not overpriced as others have mentioned, especially when compared to the likes of XP Pro which costs about four times as much",0
6816,"you do know you can download this for free?!

No it does not include a true 3D driver for the nVidia cards (XP doesn't either, btw), but you can download that for free from nVidia",0
6817,"Being responsible for a very large computer lab, I've performed many, installations of both SUSE and SLES",0
6818,"The only hardware issues I've had were once with a 3Dlabs video card (not supported), and an on-board SCSI controller (required an update)",0
6819,"Except for those, every IBM, Dell and Gateway machine I've put this on has had no problems",0
6820,It auto detects (and auto loads) drivers for a vast array of hardware and does so much better than XP,0
6821,The best feature is the included and well supported Xen engine,1
6822,It is rather cool having four different operating systems (include XP) running on the same system (Dual Xeon 3,0
6823,"6, 8GB RAM), at the same time",0
6824,"each just a mouse click away - no rebooting!  Try running the ST C64 emulator, from the STeem emulator, from a XP Pro VM, on top of SuSE with Xen, it works",0
6825,Before I start,0
6826,take those last 2 reviews with a HUGE grain of salt,0
6827,PCBuilder runs across the street to a neighbor to type up a review on this product? Sounds fishy to me,0
6828,Sounds like a Microsoft zealot trying to give a nasty plug to some much needed competition,0
6829,I run a system I built myself,0
6830,Has a 3,0
6831,"0 ghz P4 processor, 1 gig of pc3200 ram, geforce FX5500 video card, onboard lan, soundblaster live audio card, maxtor 100 gig ata/133 hard drive, sony dvd-r, sony cd-r",0
6832,that's the basics,0
6833,Out of the box it installed perfectly and ran perfectly the first time,0
6834,And it is STILL running perfectly even after my 2 children got through hammering it,0
6835,"Suse has put out what is, in my opinion, the best distro out there",0
6836,"Ok now it loads on my computer, it tells me to reboot after the install, this is where my problems started",0
6837,"Now I can't get on it to play a DVD or music or anything! I turned it off and back on same problem again, I tried to turn it off again, and again",0
6838,Now it is coming up with missing a dependency deal and it will not load now,0
6839,Nothing but problems and now I have to take my computer somewhere to have it fixed,0
6840,"It said this was a easy install, well my computer is now

hung on a GREEN screen! During the install the screen became

all lines and weird colors then it froze, I tried hit key

board buttons, but the only way to get it to shutdown was to

PULL the powercord out of the WALL! Then it would come up with

some text that would scroll by and then it would display a GREEN

screen again! ARGG

Now I am using my neighbors computer to type this review, my

computer is now useless with no Windows or anything to load up",1
6841,Exactly what I wanted,0
6842,Will shop with this seller again,1
6843,GREAT,1
6844,"Essential to reinstall this Genealogy program, which is not ;longer available from the Mromon Library !!!
It was in good condition",0
6845,No longer supported by the Family History Center but still a useful way to organize and print genealogy and save your research,0
6846,No longer available from the Church of Latter Day  Saints,0
6847,When my computer died I couldn't migrate it my new computer,0
6848,Fortunately had the files backed up,0
6849,It is a bit cumbersome to set up but works well,2
6850,I HAVE BEEN USING PAF SINCE THE 1990S,0
6851,"BEFORE I COULD UPGRADE, SUPPORT BELOW ""5"" WAS DISCONTINUED",0
6852,PAF 5,0
6853,"2 MET MY NEED TO TRANSFER ""OLD"" FILES TO NEW",0
6854,I HAVE TRIED OTHER GENEALOGY PROGRAMS,0
6855,PAF IS AMOUNT THE BEST,1
6857,"Since this is no longer available through the original source, finding it here was a great find",1
6858,I am sorry the Church of Latter Day Saints has stopped supporting this software,0
6859,It is a standard!,0
6860,"received before promised, nice packaging and reasonably priced",0
6861,It was as described,0
6862,"Thank you, Ok, so why 20 words are required is beyond me",1
6863,I will obey,0
6864,I am pleased with the purchase,1
6865,I recommend the seller,1
6866,"I also think the PAF genealogy program is the best, it outstrips Roots Magic, I would suggest all of you get a PAF disk if you can now find one,  especially if in the past you downloaded from the internet",0
6867,I am giving each one of my children a PAF 5,0
6868,2 disk as it is the best at managing your research and records at home,0
6869,"Use New Family Search as well, Family Tree and whatever else they come up with,  but what you find there has been entered by 'someone'",0
6870,Doing further research and then entering into New Search will assist others,0
6871,"Whether or not you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (I strongly recommend you should be whether or not you do ancestry research),  or some other faith or agnostic, or atheist or just a genealogy hobbiest, I strongly recommend PAF software",0
6872,"The church will not be upgrading it or offering it online as of July 15, 2013",0
6873,Never you mind it is still a great software,1
6874,It is preferred by those of us who have been using it for the past decades,0
6875,"You asked for 20 words, I have over delivered",0
6876,Thanks again to the seller,1
6877,"Ever been challenged to give a summary of a familiar bible story?  This book is your answer to prayer! It is accurate, concise and easy to read",0
6878,I highly recommend it to every parent and/or grandparent,1
6879,"This product is very hard to use, especially if you are trying to download it to a Magellan Triton 500",1
6880,Not user friendly or intuitive at all,-1
6881,"After spending $250 on a GPS, $40 on a memory card, and $100 on this software (all at the advice of REI (yeah, I bought it from REI, not Amazon)), I saw that the fine print of the software says you can't download the maps to your GPS",0
6882,What's the point of having maps sitting on your computer hard drive that you can't download to your GPS?  My computer hard drive isn't going hiking,0
6883,My computer hard drive isn't hunting for difficult-to-find street,0
6884,My computer hard drive isn't doing a search and rescue mission,0
6885,"Oh, but if your computer hard drive ever DOES want to go hiking, it won't get lost",0
6886,"You, on the other hand, will be lost and out $80-$100 if you buy this software",0
6887,"If you thought National Geographic was a reputable organization, they're not!  (And I guess the same is true of REI",0
6888,)  And does Amazon warn you about this -- not that I've found so far,0
6889,Good product and fairly easy to use,1
6890,The software allows you create straightforward topo maps at whatever scale you desire,0
6891,I am an archaeologist and most mapping software is extremely expensive,-1
6892,TOPO! is reasonable priced and produces quality results,1
6893,The only reason I did not give 5-stars is because the waypoint labeling information is cumbersome and difficult to edit,0
6894,This is a good program with many useful features,1
6895,I use it primarily for hiking and backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas,0
6896,The excellent quality maps that I can print out are perfect to use in conjunction with my GPS receiver,1
6897,"You can't download the topo maps into the GPSr, but that's okay since the GPSr has such a small screen (and I prefer having a paper map in hand when hiking)",0
6898,The program also lets me plot courses along trails and calculate hiking distances,0
6899,The elevation profile tool has been very handy and there is an option to include the profile at the bottom of a map print out,0
6900,"My only complaint is that the USGS maps used by the program do not have all of the trails that other paper maps include (but then again, I've found a few trails in this program that aren't on some of my other paper maps)",0
6901,"I also save waypoints and courses to a """,0
6902,"gpx"" file which I can then import into Google Earth to get a better feel for terrain and vegetation",0
6903,I give it 4/5 Star because it is not perfect (see above complaint) but it is close,1
6904,"Overall, I highly recommend this program for anyone who enjoys hiking in California's mountains",1
6905,This program does have some good features - but the interface is awkward and it crashes frequently,1
6906,"Also, the USGS web site provides free downloads of all 1:24,000 quadrangle maps",0
6907,With a little trim and paste work you can get custom areas and you don't have to spend good money and not good software,2
6908,"Doesn't interface with our GPS, but made a recent trip up California's PCH even more interesting and informative",-1
6909,All the little trailheads we usually drive past were on there for hike planning,0
6910,Changing disks along the way were a bit inconvenient,0
6911,The best part of this package is the possibility to have all maps in hiking friendly 1:24000 scale,1
6912,"Though these maps are not really up to date, not really recommendable for power hikers in the CA bay area",-1
6913,"Also on the down side is the strange user interface, you really have to get used to it",0
6914,Considering some crashes of the software itself I can only give 3 stars,0
6915,"But it is at least the best GPS mapping software I know, among the blind the one-eyed is king",0
6916,UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows,0
6917,Great news--when I installed this 4,0
6918,"0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it",0
6919,"I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software",0
6920,"I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update",0
6921,"I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to",0
6922,"I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it",0
6923,National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same),0
6924,"First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver",0
6925,These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7,0
6926,5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps),0
6927,But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway,0
6928,"It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck",0
6929,"NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!",0
6930,"This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works",1
6931,"Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information",0
6932,"Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind",0
6933,These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS,0
6934,"You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS",0
6935,This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface,1
6936,You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been,0
6937,"And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route",0
6938,"The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike",2
6939,"The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it",0
6940,"If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error",0
6941,"One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof",0
6942,This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series,0
6943,This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition,1
6944,BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx,0
6945,"It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001",0
6946,For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs,0
6947,The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition,0
6948,"In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software",0
6949,But for some reason they don't,0
6950,So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps,0
6951,Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx,0
6952,I then have to save the,0
6953,"tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the",0
6955,"Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work",0
6956,I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps,0
6957,The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions,0
6958,"For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen",0
6959,"You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button",0
6960,The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is,0
6961,"Another observation is that there is no EDIT menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications",0
6962,But these are relatively small concerns that you can quickly adapt to,0
6963,All in all this is a very valuable tool that I highly recommend,1
6964,I have not used this product extensively but it had proven to be very useful for my needs,0
6965,I am very pleased with it and only have a couple of comments,1
6966,"It has an excellent search tool and has found almost every location that I have searched on, even some very little and very remote campgrounds",0
6967,This is what I was mainly interested in as the other software's I have used are very (VERY) limited in this,0
6968,The only two things that I have noticed is that it does have fixed zoom ratios and the wildlife areas that I am interested in are shaded dark grey when zoomed in which is somewhat maddening,0
6969,They could have used a lighter grey as it is very hard to see the mapping in these shaded areas,0
6970,That is the only reason I am dropping my rating down to a 4,0
6971,"This product is very user friendly and I would highly recommend it, so far it has been the best bang for the buck!",1
6972,Digitizing the trails and creating profiles along with flyovers is as slick and easy as can be,0
6973,The same goes with plotting GPS points from ASCII onto my TOPO maps or from them,0
6974,"I love the features of this product, but it has stability issues",1
6975,I have a recent laptop running Windows 7,0
6976,"The product loads fine, but it crashes when I attempt to save files or open files - not very helpful, since my goal is to mark up maps for hunting purposes and save them to disk",0
6977,"I loaded the SW on a Sony PC also running Windows 7, and it works fine",0
6978,"I submitted a bug report over a week ago, and I got no response - not very inspiring",0
6979,"Its a great application, but you are taking a gamble if you have Windows 7",1
6980,Be informed that the claim to be compatible with Garmin is bogus,0
6981,"Although it can read the signal from Garmin, it will not upload the maps",0
6982,Makes it pretty worthless as a GPS addon,1
6983,These maps are great! It works wonderfully with the magellan triton 1500 and the others in the series,0
6984,You can download the maps with your own waypoints and routes directly to your triton! Just be sure to download the updates first,0
6985,"If you are going to just mark your route on their maps, look at the elevation profile, print it, etc then the product is pretty good",0
6986,"The problem comes when you realize that the underlying USGS quadrangles are often badly out of date with man-made things, such as trails and park boundaries",0
6987,There is no support for updating the maps in the style of the original,0
6988,"Still, you can make passable updates -- just invent your own conventions",0
6989,You can merge in someone else's updates -- the problem comes if you then get a revised version of those updates,0
6990,There is no supported way to do the second merge (i,0
6991,"replace the first merge with the newer one), or to back out the first merge (i",0
6992,to remove what the first merge put in without also removing any updates you yourself may have added) so that the newer merge can go cleanly,0
6993,Overall a decent product,1
6994,Plain vanilla out-of-the-box stuff works fine,0
6995,"Trying to upgrade the maps to be truly useful for your area can be pretty frustrating, though",-1
6996,"One thing to beware of: National Geographic is trying to migrate folks to their newer product, TOPO!Explorer",0
6997,Take a look at *that* product's reviews -- it only gets one star (5 reviews),0
6998,I had high hopes that this software would be very helpful in mapping out weekend hikes,0
6999,"Much to my regret, it falls far short",-1
7000,I can overlook the poor interface,-1
7001,I knew going into this that I could not download the maps to my Garmin,0
7002,"I wanted only to be able to plot out hikes, print out the paper maps, and transfer the route to the Garmin",0
7003,"All this works to a degree, with the map quality limiting the plotting",0
7004,Unfortunately the quality of the maps falls short of usable,-1
7005,The map data is too small to use until blown up past level 5,-1
7006,At this point it starts getting fuzzy and blurs badly,-1
7007,"I guess that I should have realized that a raster map when blown up too far, starts degrading badly",0
7008,"The worst part was that when I asked for assistance on this problem, I traded a few emails with a support person at the product website, and then when my questions got specific and I supplied him with samples, I no longer heard from him",-1
7009,He just quit replying,0
7010,I will be asking for an RMA,0
7011,"Too bad - It sounded like a great product, but did not live up to expectations",-1
7012,this product (CA version) is listed for $149 at Amazon and at $99 at the National Geographic website and at REI,0
7013,What's up with that?  50% over the MSRP?,0
7014,TOPO! has the worst user interface ever created,-1
7015,"It doesn't follow the standard user interface designed by Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft",0
7016,- There's no hand tool to move around the map--rather you have to move your cursor to the edge of the screen and click to push the map around,0
7017,"Hard to control and creates lots of cursor movement
- The tool to draw routes is hard to control",0
7018,Do not waste your money on this horrible software,-1
7019,Even on a 2,0
7020,"4 GHz, 2 GB RAM MacBook Pro, it staggers to run",0
7021,It takes an average of 20 seconds just to change zoom levels and pans incredibly slowly,2
7022,Try drawing a route and half the time the whole thing freezes and crashes and you have to start over,0
7023,I'll say it again - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,-1
7024,UPDATE: In the end they send me a brand new version (not an update anymore) and it all worked out,0
7025,I'm still using TOPO,0
7026,":)

I now have their latest TOPO! 4",0
7027,"5, but cannot use it with my California State series maps",0
7028,I've been exchanging e-mails with their customer support and they basically just recycle cut and paste's from their web site,0
7029,"At first I took their instructions (often contradictory) seriously and did everything they said, but none of it works",0
7030,To make sure I tried it on a different computer,0
7031,No go,0
7032,"The software often hangs up for long time, so anything you try kills a lot of time",0
7033,I think it is just a very badly written code with no backward compatibility,-1
7034,I'm going to start looking for another product,-1
7035,I have been using Topo! since it was a Wildflower product back in the early 1990's,0
7036,"The interface does take some getting used to as mentioned before, but like all powerful software programs (vi/emacs) eventually, it becomes second nature",0
7037,"I mostly use TOPO! to annotate my previous trips, plan future trips, share travel guides with family, and create georeferenced raster maps for handheld GPS devices",0
7038,"My trips primarily used to be hiking and backpacking trips, which I would dutifully record using an old Garmin Etrex GPS receiver",0
7039,The tracks and waypoints would be uploaded to the desktop and saved as separate,0
7040,tpo files,0
7041,"Back in the day, I was plenty happy just to see waypoint times and elevation gains as documentation of my backcountry trips",0
7042,I would also use TOPO to create waypoint routes (up to 30) to be uploaded to the GPS receiver so that I could plan/program my future hikes into the Etrex,0
7043,"Since those early primitive days, both TOPO! and I have changed a lot! TOPO! has improved significantly in its featurea",0
7044,"Now that I have two kids and more money, my outdoor travels consist mostly of Jeeping, dry car camping, and ancient rock art hunting",0
7045,"Now, with the newer versions of TOPO, it is possible to add pictures and notes",0
7046,"In turn, these more detailed maps can be useful as travelogues not only for nostalgia, but also as travel guides for family members and friends who are using TOPO! as well",0
7047,"While similar functionality could be obtained by using Google Earth or Maps, this map sharing is dependent on ""cloud computing""",0
7048,"This may be feasible when sitting in a coffee shop in a metropolis or even at home, but out in the desert without cellphone access this is not a viable option",0
7049,"Further, Google Map data is only protected by obscurity",0
7050,Any person who knows the URL to your map data can view it,0
7051,"Since I don't have to carry gear on my back anymore, I primarily use TOPO in the field on a laptop with an external GPS receiver",0
7052,"Though bulky, it is a much more useful combination than simply a tiny handheld receiver alone due to the larger size of the laptop screen and the ability to search for waypoints using the standard keyboard",0
7053,My family uses a similar setup and they too find it reassuring to know that they have a clearly mapped GPS route available to them in the wild,0
7054,"Finally, the most useful aspect of TOPO! is unfortunately no longer available, unless you can beg, borrow, or steal a boxed Xport Pro package",1
7055,NatGeoMaps recently and quite quietly killed off its entire TopoPro line (including for ArcGIS),0
7056,Xport Pro (formerly $199) allows the user to export high quality USGS maps in the georeferenced GeoTiff format,0
7057,These GeoTiffs could then be used in shareware GPS programs like OziExplorer for Windows computers or OziWince or NoniGPSplot for WinCE GPS devices (many personal navigation devices can be cracked to run these apps in addition to the installed street mapping software),0
7058,"It used to be that you could call in a credit card number to NatGeoMaps customer service and for $99 get the functionality activated through a PIN, but no longer :(",0
7059,"Admittedly, GeoTiff, mrsid, and many other georeferenced maps can be downloaded from state governments (usually from depts of ag or wildlife management), but having it all in one software package on CD's is pretty sweet",0
7060,UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows,0

7107,All in all this is a very valuable tool that I highly recommend,1
7108,Before I bought this product I found it difficult to find reviews of Nat,0
7109,"Geographic topo state software as well as MapTech Terrain Navigator software, so I am giving this input for future customers",0
7110,MapTech provides a demo,0
7111,I'd say I prefer MapTech's 3D to Nat,0
7112,Geographic's 3D version,0
7114,Geographic provides more features such as greater grid spacing options,1
7115,"But don't expect either to print with the resolution of the regular 1:24,000 USGS maps; both software brands have to default to a larger scale to get that kind of resolution and clarity at least with ink jet printers",0
7116,"National Geographic Topo's 50% default setting results in an approximate print scale of 1:31,000 which results in very good clarity",0
7117,"However even at 1:24,000 they are legible (although a bit fuzzy)",0
7118,"They will both save you money verses buying the regular topo maps (after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink and paper costs) plus they give you advantages if you use a gps unit especially in overlaying grids, trail markers, etc",0
7119,", on the printed-out maps",0
7120,"But don't forget it takes more than (4) 8 1/2"" x 11"" printouts to match one regular store bought 1:24,000 topo map",0
7121,"I've used the software for years, and highly recommend it to our customers",1

7138,It doesn't teach you how to construct sentences,0

7145,There are 6 different software programs on 6 discs,0
7146,The only complaint I have is that you need to swap discs for each level - good and bad,0
7147,"In addition to the software, there is an audio cd as well as a DVD that you can play on a DVD player and an extra game",0
7148,I haven't figured out the game yet but it is an adventure game that you need to navigate in Spanish,0
7149,There is no manual so it isn't easy to figure out,0

7165,This would not even be worth a dollar,-1
7166,You will NOT be able to learn Spanish with this,0
7167,Invest in Rosetta Stone instead,0
7168,Don't waste your money with this cheap knock off,-1
7169,"What you will learn might be a few simple vocabulary words and some terms or sentences but you can learn those for free from free programs, or apps or even from ""Dora the Explorer"" on TV",0
7170,You'd learn more from exposure to Telemundo than you will from this!  Don't buy it!,-1
7171,Seems like the program itself is ok but I was looking for something to use while commuting,0
7172,The CD's are not compatible,0
7173,"great price point
easy to use
kid friendly
reviewed by teachers and it was recommended
used by all ages jr high, hs, and adult",1
7174,*I like the fact that I can sit in my living room with earbuds in my ears in the middle of a group doing their own thing and learn (repeating over and over) Spanish,0
7175,I like how vocab is in a male voice and then a female voice switching with each click,0
7176,I get to hear the pitch differences which have been so helpful,0
7177,"*I am happy that info is delivered incrementally and you can go anywhere you want, basic to difficult and back again",0
7178,"You can even wear it while you sleep and learn it subliminally if you like! Or, learn it in your car using the mp3 disc",0
7179,It is very versatile,1
7180,"Works great, arrived quickly and my wife is well on her way to speaking spanish!  Much cheaper than rosetta stone",1
7181,Great quick and easy way to learn Spanish on the fly,1
7182,Does not concentrate on the reading of a language,0
7183,Maybe it's me and I'm just not capable of learning a foreign language as an adult (funny I didn't have this hard a time with high school german),0
7184,I just cannot seem to learn from these spanish software programs - this is the third I've tried,0
7185,"For me, I have had the best luck with repetitive audio programs I can listen to in the car or while running in my ipod - maybe it's just that as an adult I do not have the time to sit and do a program and get nothing else done",0
7186,Easy to use,1
7187,I like that you can use it on your computer but also learn more by transferring lessons to your iPod and learning while on the go,0
7188,I learned a little bit but it didn't completely hold my attention or make me feel immersed,0
7189,"Granted, I should have tried this more but nothing compelled me to keep coming back to it",0
7190,This set has been around a long time and always a great way to supplement other spanish language courses,0
7191,Worth the investment,1
7192,My seventh grade homeschooled daughter has been using this product to learn Spanish,0
7193,It is easy enough to set up that she was able to do it all on her own,1
7194,"We'd purchased Rosetta Stone at a much higher price, but she likes this one better",1
7195,My husband and I bought it for our niece in law and she hasn't said not one negative word about the software to us,0
7196,We guess she loves it!,1
7197,I'm having a difficult time reviewing this because - well it didn't help me learn Spanish any better than any of the other three CD sets I've tried,0
7198,But that could and probably is just my thick skull,0
7199,Maybe if I were better at learning a new language this would be more helpful,0
7200,It probably would have helped if I had listened more consistently,0
7201,I'm giving it three stars because while it didn't do much for me I don't think I put the right amount of effort into it to be a success,0
7202,I brought this product to help in college but it was a waist of time because it only teach you the basic for example 1 to 20,0
7203,This product does not help you at all,-1
7204,The software looks cheap and the games are boring and pointless,-1
7205,Don't buy unless you just want to know random greetings and numbers,0
7206,This system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students,0
7207,It is as good as other systems that cost you much more,0
7208,"I think that Spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years, and this system gives you a good start",0
7209,I don't think this is a program that will really teach someone a whole language despite it's stated advertisement to that effect,0
7210,I do think this is a good program to use hand in hand with another,-1
7211,"Such as attending a Spanish class or even better, hanging out with Spanish speaking friends",0
7212,The interface is easy to use for adults and kids alike,1
7213,"The vocabulary drills and quizzes are mildly entertaining, at least in small doses",0
7214,Having never used Rosetta I can't compare the two except to say at 10% or less of the Rosetta price I think this is well worth the expenditure as a supplementary way to practice the Spanish language,0
7215,"I purchased ""Instant Immersion"" instead of Rosetta Stone which way more expensive",0
7216,I started to like it until I found out that there is no written material,0
7217,"No book, no pdf, nothing",0
7218,Most would agree: 99% of any class I've taken had/required a book,0
7219,"This one doesn't, but it needs one",0
7220,I'm sending my Instant Immersion back,0
7221,"This pack is only level 1,2,3, which is equivalent of 1,2, of Rosetta stone, therefor it is only 100$ savings over Rosetta",0
7222,"I still think it is worth the money, for it does provide vocabulary builder",1
7223,"I would recommend getting used one, for it is just a basics Spanish",1
7224,I had no problem with installing software on My PC with Windows 7,0
7225,I took Spanish in high school and college so I know and understand what some may consider to be a lot,0
7226,But I am far from fluent,0
7227,I would say I can talk with a child and even then I am not fluent,0
7228,This program did not help me in my goal to become fluent,0
7229,It did help me increase my vocabulary but as far as becoming a Spanish speaker this program did not help,0
7230,I also found some errors with the translations,0
7231,An example is the english speaker said I am from a town and on the screen it said I am from a town called Madrid,0
7232,"Like I said I know some Spanish but this program has not helped me to become fluent!  When I read the reviews it was as good as Rosetta stone but the tech support was not there, I find this not to be true",0
7233,I have gotten the test demo from then and thought it to be more helpful,0
7234,"Thank you for sending it on time, but the box was destroyed when it arrived because whoever packed it, wrapped it in a paper grocery bag",1
7235,"really?? Maybe next time, put your merchandise in something a little sturdier so when it arrives to your client, we don't get damaged goods (just a thought)",0
7236,"I have not been able to start learning Spanish, because for some reason, the disks will not play in my computer or DVD player",0
7237,even though the box clearly states that it is compatible,1
7238,"So, I'm not thrilled, but it did arrive on time",0
7239,beat up as it was,0
7240,It's kind of a fun program,0
7241,"My boys (3 & 5) love computer ""games"", and to them, this is something of a game",0
7242,"The vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of: here are some words, now you repeat them, now you answer which is which",0
7243,That seems to work pretty well,1
7244,"I have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet, so I can't say anything there at this time",0
7245,"One factor that I really like is that the program has TWO Spanish speakers, so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words",0
7246,"We will keep using this, and I hope to come back and update this review when I have gotten to the grammar lessons",0
7247,Wasted 600 dollar,-1
7248,ROSETTA STONE DOESN'T WORK!!!! Level 1 works but once the words became ANYTHING LONGER THAN 6 LETTERS,-1
7249,IT'S BASICALLY USELESS AND ONLY FRUSTRATES YOU,-1
7250,My mom is from Spain and is completely fluent and the VOICE Recognition kept on saying she wasn't saying it RIGHT and later she had one of her Spanish friends try it and it did the same,0
7251,"DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY,  if you do I will sell you mine",-1
7252,It states on the box: The difference between immersion and rosetta is $500,0
7253,"There are very few things if any, about this program that is like rosetta",0
7254,I was able to learn more conversation with the rosetta demo disc than this 1-5 lesson box,0
7255,"This is helpful ALONG WITH ANOTHER METHOD, or as a BRUSH UP on words",0
7256,The pics are like clip art and not realistic so its not as helpful for every day speaking,0
7257,If price comparing,0
7258,then for 1/10th the price as compared to a total learning program then not bad,0
7259,They really should not act like they are comparable to Rosetta,0
7260,They do not come close to the quality and learning,0
7261,again 1/10 the price 1/10 the learning,0
7262,I will keep this as a brush up though or maybe give it as a gift for someone to start out with or brush up,0
7263,"If I had never demoed Rosetta OR they didn't ADVERTISE ""LIKE ROSETTA"" then I would have given them a bit better review",0
7264,I say false advertisement,0
7265,I agree with the review about the packaging being decieving,0
7266,"But again as a brush up or starter, not bad, but if I am gonna spend the money and time to learn the whole language",0
7267,I will go with Rosetta and kick it in the teeth,0
7268,"The software provides a nice start if you want to learn spanish, but it does not deliver a complete course up to a certain level",0
7269,"The set up is that you start talking about business and technology pretty quick, without having received any grammar and practice that comes with that",0
7270,"You learn words and basis phrases first, but only in the present tense",0
7271,"Past tenses or other tenses are not being explained, which is in my opinion more important than talking business (if I would go and talk business in spanish, I would like to know how to make proper phrases in general, before I can actually worry about business talk)",0
7272,The word practice and the games are really good and very easy to use,1
7273,"It is also sort of ""fun"" so it does motivate a lot to do it",0
7274,"The phrases however are a bit slow and a bit confusing, the words are first spoken in English and even I who does not speak any spanish (yet) can notice that the translations are not very accurate (which is in my opinion a very important thing in a language course)",0
7275,"Since they don't explain anything else, about the grammar, it is a bit confusing when the phrases are not very correct",0
7276,"For example, the English voice says; What soup do you have? The spanish translation to that is: ""Tiene sopa?"" which I think means: Do you have soup? and has nothing to do with what kind of soup they have",0
7277,"After that the answer is followed, but only in Spanish and is not translated in the help language",0
7278,"There is a picture in the screen however, with some sort of vegetable soup, but the answer is ""Hoy tenemos sopa de ajo casera"" which I think is quite complicated to figure out that their answer is that they have soup (from the house or home made) with garlic!
This course is nice to learn vocabulary and to have on the side, but you do need a proper book or classes to get into the real conversational spanish, because just with this, it is not possible to learn all of that",0
7279,"I feel sorry for people who bought Rosetta Stone and spend so much money on this (since the reviews do acknowledge that it provides quite the same), because I do think that for this price, this is really a good product, they just should promise a bit less than they do now, and they should sell it as a great vocabulary builder, which it really is",0
7280,I bought this product for my daughter who is struggling in Spanish in college,1
7281,"After one week, she understood and spoke spanish better than she had after two years in high school",0
7282,Her test grades improved and her conversation grade improved,0
7283,The teacher noted her improvement,0
7284,"Instant Immersion Spanish 1,2 & 3",0
7285,We purchased this product to give us a basic introduction to Spanish,1
7286,"Right off the bat, none of the disks would work with a Mac",0
7287,I tried three different Macs and encountered the same frustration,0
7288,The disks simply will not mount,0
7289,I can't review the effectiveness of the language lessons because we could only open the workbook,0
7290,Do not waste your time,-1
7291,We will be retuning this product to the store/manufaturer!,0
7292,This is not Rosetta Stone or any other curriculum,0
7293,"There is no ""Scope or Sequence"" to follow",0
7294,My kids have fun with the games,0
7295,"One complaint is the ""people"" say the words too fast and the pronounciation isn't the clearest",0
7296,For the price it maybe right for some people,1
7297,You do not need to spend hundreds of dollars on the other people who spend so much on advertising their product! This one is the real deal,0
7298,Easy to use,1
7299,iPod/iPhone friendly,1
7300,My husband is already speaking a lot of Spanish after a month! It's truly incredible,1
7301,He is ready for his trips to several Spanish speaking countries,0
7302,Instant Immersion Spanish is a good place to start learning Spanish,0
7303,The cost alone makes it a nearly risk free purchase,0
7304,"Will it make you fluent?  No it won't, but I'm seeing it for a 'low' price with free shipping",0
7305,"What have you got to lose?  I can't comment on how it compares to Rosetta  Stone,  but just their Level 1 alone is 5 x the $'s",0
7306,"The program CD's focus on teaching words and basic phrases, these are OK, but really don't get too in depth with what you need to know to really learn Spanish",0
7307,The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk,0
7308,"This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish",0
7309,"There isn't any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price",0
7310,"The ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD game is really lame",0
7311,They could have just omitted it,0
7312,"As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part",0
7313,The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90's,0
7314,I really didn't get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere,0
7315,"There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years",0
7316,I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate,0
7317,"For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not",0
7318,This kind of made me wonder why,0
7319,"Based primarily of the price point, I do recommend this program as a starting point for learning Spanish",1
7320,"There are many other free resources online that you can use to supplement the course including translators, traveler cheat sheets and so on",0
7321,This program is definitely a good investment to learn basic Spanish or just brush up,0
7322,It costs far less than comparable programs like Rosetta Stone,0
7323,"I wish there was more vocabulary in it, but I have learned a lot and am able to make and understand basic conversation",0
7324,My favorite part is that I can put it on my IPOD and take it with me wherever I go,0
7325,I don't see someone learning the language,0
7326,There is very little actual instruction,0
7327,It provides very limited practice and relies heavily on oral input without accompanying written word,0
7328,Brief lessons are followed by a  game approach,0
7329,Basic guessing results in high scores,0
7330,Not worth the money,-1
7331,I'll try Rosetta Stone instead,0
7332,"I've tried several times to give this set a fair shake, but I just don't like it",0
7333,It feels sort of like a cut-budget Rosetta Stone software,0
7334,I don't feel as though I'm learning anything; the lessons are disjointed and sometimes confusing; and there seem to be way more discs than there should be (a language program like this can't be taking up THAT MUCH memory!),0
7335,"All in all, if I needed to really learn Spanish, I'd go looking elsewhere for an effective product",0
7336,"I liked the pace of this, and it was thorough",1
7337,"However, the use of the improper and Southern slang English ""y'all"" drove me crazy!!!  Made me wonder if they were using incorrect Spanish as well?",0
7338,"Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software",0
7339,"After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product",0
7340,Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars,0
7341,"If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star",0
7342,But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language,0
7343,"At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words",0
7344,"For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars",0
7345,"Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price",0
7346,The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know,0
7347,And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation,0
7348,"I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc",0
7349,The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while,0
7350,The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2,0
7351,The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons,0
7352,There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all,0
7353,I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game,0
7354,"In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program",0
7355,But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful,1
7356,"The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office",0
7357,"What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the ""vos"" (as opposed to ""vosotros"") is used instead of the ""tu"" form",1
7358,One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family,0
7359,The DVD is can be used on the TV,0
7360,"But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while",0
7361,One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish,0
7362,"Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it",1
7363,Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish,1
7364,This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner,1
7365,"Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software",0
7366,"But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner",0
7367,"If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go",0
7368,"To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs",0
7369,"The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1",0
7370,1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software,0
7371,The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day,0
7372,And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency,0
7373,The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily,1
7374,"The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>",0
7375,This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable,0
7376,To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series,0
7377,"I purchased this item six weeks ago in hopes of refreshing my basic understanding of spanish, which I hadnt used in any form in years",0
7378,"While I won't go so far as to say this item is a complete failure, I will say that it is definitely lacking",0
7379,"The simplest analogy I can think of is this software goes from step one to step three, and leaves you wondering what was supposed to be in the middle",0
7380,"I have tested each cd, some as high as a dozen times, and feel no strong connection to the software",0
7381,"I find that the nouns, verbs, and sayings that I had previously learned are sticking, but most of whats new is failing to make an impression",0
7382,"I even write each word on an index card, along with the phonetic spelling, and then review the word later to make more of a connection",0
7383,"Without taking those extra few steps, I feel like I would have learned 10% as much as I have, which hasn't been much",0
7384,"The review games are hacky,and most of the visuals are crude cartoon drawings",0
7385,"Furthermore, one male and one female greet you on some of the lesson screens in an attempt to simulate someone talking",0
7386,"In reality, there's a two second loop that plays for each person, and it skips then repeats over and over as long as the lesson is going",0
7387,"It doesnt sound like much, and Im having a hard time accurately describing the presentation, but trust me, its annoying",0
7388,"All in all, the product isn't terrible, but I don't expect to fully absorb more than a few hundred words due solely to this software",2
7389,"If I had had the 749 Rosetta Stone wanted, I probably would have went that route",0
7390,"But hey, for 29",0
7391,"99, adding 500 words to my spanish vocabulary isn't that bad after all",0
7392,My children and I are using this to learn Spanish,0
7393,We love to compete with each other on the quizzes on the dvd,0
7394,We have not been able to use the computer discs though because our cd drive broke,0
7395,But we are learning a lot from the dvd,0
7396,"However, the girl's accent is thick and a little hard to understand at times but since they put the words on the screen you can figure out how to say it",0
7397,Have not yet begun in earnest,0
7398,Looks very adaquate for what I was looking for,0
7399,The games make it less onerous,0
7400,"This is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and I am running on Win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program, not my machine",0
7401,It slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the CD,0
7402,The product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks,0
7403,Two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace,0
7404,"Some disks require installing programs such as Flash, and Quick Time",0
7405,I don't like programs that use because Flash contains spy-ware (tracking) that you have to go to the Adobe website to disable,-1
7406,Some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format,0
7407,If I had demoed Instant Immersion first I never would have bought it,0
7408,You get out what you put in,0
7409,"This system lets you learn words and phrases, then match them to pictures and audio with games",0
7410,It would be great for a child to use,1
7411,I had found it necessary to communicate with spanish people who refuse to learn our language,0
7412,I had put it off long enough and now use the system for relaxation after a long day at work,0
7413,This is the first type of system I have used and for the price you simply cannot beat it,0
7414,Don't waste your money on a more expensive system before trying this one,-1
7415,I cannot stress enough how absolutely terrible this software is,-1
7416,It freezes my computer within 15 minutes of putting it in,0
7417,A help box constantly comes up saying that there is a timing error,0
7418,The quality is bare minimum,0
7419,Don't waste you're money on it,-1
7420,save your money,-1
7421,"just save it and spend on rosetta stone, if you really want to learn spanish",0
7422,Thanks,1
7423,"This is tourist stuff, too simple",0
7424,"I've used Rosetta Stone and I've used this Immersion program, and this one just cannot compare",0
7425,"It is repetitive to the point of annoying, the graphics are awful, and it does not have the intuitive learning progression the Rosetta programs have",0
7426,Definitely a poor choice,-1
7427,"I'm very pleased, I'm getting better with my spanish all the time",1
7428,It seems much easier then any other program I've tried,1
7429,First time user of this product,0
7430,"Gives a good introduction to the language,plus it! s  fun",1
7431,"For the price,would recommend to anyone",1
7432,This product was a waste of money,-1
7433,The primary problem with it was that it is not a coherent product--it is a poorly repackaged mishmash of other products,-1
7434,My wife purchased this (not on Amazon) to try to improve her vocabulary which had gotten rusty,0
7435,"She found that the first disc was mostly okay, but several other discs were outdated programs designed for children, or wouldn't even run at all without installing other software such as the execrable QuickTime",0
7436,She found that there was no apparent transition from the beginner disc to a much more advanced disc,0
7437,"If there was an intermediate disc, it was one of the ones that wouldn't run",0
7438,The best portions of the software come from a company called Eurotalk,0
7439,"This means the dialect of Spanish being taught is not American Spanish, but European Spanish, which is much less useful unless you happen to be planning a trip to Europe",0
7440,"This seriously reduces its usefulness to Americans looking to improve their Spanish skills for the sake of improving their marketability for a job, for instance",0
7441,"The fact that this was European Spanish was not mentioned on the packaging, so we were misled",0
7442,"And the Eurotalk segments are not all in the same series, so some are for kids and some are not",0
7443,"Worst of all, the money-back guarantee offered by the makers of the product is a complete sham",-1
7444,"To get your money back you have to ship them the software, for which they recommend you purchase insurance and use a trackable method, and include a letter asking for a refund, then wait 6-8 weeks for your refund",0
7445,"If you don't get it, you have only an address to write to to ask where your money is or you can e-mail them",0
7446,"Oh, and they don't refund your shipping or your sales tax",-1
7447,Cute,1
7448,"What's the difference between them and Rosetta Stone? They claim the difference is only about $500, but at least Rosetta Stone is selling a complete product",0
7449,For those who are looking for an immersive form of Spanish learning that is less expensive and slightly less immersive (i,0
7450,"will give you a little English to work with) than Rosetta Stone, don't expect to get much out of this product",0
7451,"Keep looking for something from a reputable company and read all the reviews, and above all stay away from anything by Topics Media, the resellers who put this package together and wasted our money",0
7452,I have use rosetta stone and I think this is very similar,0
7453,"Definitely try it, the price is better than most other programs",0
7454,"Thank you, it was everything you said it was",1
7455,I'm glad I decided to purchase this,1
7456,Such great service,1
7457,Thank you again,1
7458,Will purchase from this site again,1
7459,This product is not like Rosetta Stone at all,-1
7460,"If you like the format of that product, then this product is not going to be satisfactory",0
7461,The game is the best part of it,1
7462,My son purchased this program,0
7463,He is an EMT and wanted to learn Spanish to help his patients,0
7464,He said he loves the program,1
7465,You can't beat the price,0
7466,It repeats words back to you so you get the correct pronunciation,0
7467,My son-in-law is Spanish speaking and bought the Spanish to English program,0
7468,His English noticeably improved when he started using the program,0
7469,"It's like anything else, you have to keep doing it",0
7470,I would definitely recommend this product,1
7471,I don't know about comparing this item to Rosetta Stone,0
7472,RS is very expensive,-1
7473,It's extraordinarily expensive,-1
7474,Instant Immersion is a great starting place to introduce foreign language to children: 1,0
7475,"It's interactive, engaging and entertaining",1
7476,It's a less-expensive alternative than other programs,0
7477,This is better than a textbook or from a class,0
7478,Correct pronunciation is at your fingertips,0
7479,You just can't get that from reading,0
7480,Associate visual and audio cues to aid in learning,0
7481,I don't have to worry about the smart kids dictating the pace of the class,0
7482,"Based on a recent study, it was determined that repetitive testing (practice exams) help us develop cues to learning foreign words",0
7483,"For example, windu is Swahili for clouds",0
7484,"It's easy to associate ""wind"" with clouds",0
7485,The reason I mention this is that these software programs can significantly aid our brains in developing multiple associations,0
7486,"We see the pictures, we hear the speaker and we determine the rate of our learning progress",0
7487,The negative: Discipline,-1
7488,It's tough to sit down and dedicate the time needed to learn the language unless this is made part of an after-school assignment or maybe a homeschool learning objective,0
7489,"For me personally, it is easier to ""have to go to class""",0
7490,It's a catch-22: I'm compelled to learn by having to keep up with the rest of the class vs,0
7491,being able to learn at my own pace if I can just sit down and keep motivated to learn,0
7492,I was pleased when God led me to this product,1
7493,I had wanted to purchase the Rosetta Stone software but found it too expensive,0
7494,Then God showed me this software in a catalogue,0
7495,"Although I have only used Disk one of this program, I can say that it is a fun way to learn a language",0
7496,The pictures make learning the the vocabulary easier,0
7497,I took Spanish while I was in school,0
7498,"Now, more than ten years later, I'm using this as mostly a review",0
7499,"I like Instant Immersion, and would recommend it because it's fun and you can't lose at $35",0
7500,This is a great product,1
7501,It's very user friendly and lots of fun,1
7502,I think it is well worth the cost,1
7503,I have recommended this product to my friends and co-workers,1
7504,I got this CD rom set and it is just horrible,-1
7505,It is not even a 1/20th as good as Rosetta Stone (that's the price ratio),0
7506,"The games look like they were made in the 80s, they also run slow because they are all coming from a CD Rom",0
7507,The vocabulary is merely okay,0
7508,They show you the item and you're supposed to pick what it is,0
7509,"Honestly, it's not that difficult to mess that up",0
7510,I was very disappointed in the voice/microphone aspect of it,-1
7511,"With instant immersion you speak into the microphone, but the program doesn't grade/rate how well you did it",0
7512,"It just records it, so you can listen to yourself again",0
7513,"What good is that? In Rosetta Stone, the program actually determines how well you said it and gives you a rating, this really helped me improve my accent",0
7514,"Also for vocabulary, you can get an even better program and it's FREE",0
7515,Go to SpanishDict com and their flashcard games are great,1
7516,"They even have video lectures, which are also free",0
7517,"Back to Instant Immersion, the grammar portion seemed okay, it involved you putting random phrases in the correct order",0
7518,"For people with a decent amount of Spanish, this program is also too basic, which I should've been tipped off on by Level 1,2,3",0
7519,What prevents this from getting 1 star is the company's awesome return policy,0
7520,"A week after buying it, I mailed the product back to the company asking for a refund (because they have a money back offer) and a month later, I got a check in the mail",0
7521,"I had to pay for shipping, which wasn't too much",0
7522,"So if you're on the fence, buy this product and if you hate it like me, send it back for a full refund",0
7523,"In the end, all you risked is about 4 bucks for return shipping",0
7524,Disc is damaged,-1
7525,"has loud ""humming noise"" that is very distracting while trying to learn",0
7526,Shipping and packaging was; however quick and efficient,1
7527,I got this program so I could keep my fluency at about the same level over summer break,0
7528,I was really hoping for a basic program that would simply teach you Spanish and allow you to listen to Spanish conversations and try to interpret them,0
7529,But this product is clearly aimed at elementary school children,1
7530,It is laden with a heavy graphical interface,0
7531,I wouldn't get this program if you were serious about learning Spanish,0
7532,I just couldn't use it because it is so ridiculous,0
7533,It doesn't even make sense,0
7534,It might just be better to get Rosetta Stone,0
7535,But RS costs like 500 dollars,0
7536,You pay for what you get I guess,0
7537,"It also never really ""Immerses"" you in Spanish",0
7538,Even if you were to ignore the interface it is still a very poor learning experience,0
7539,Maybe if you want you child to try and learn Spanish this program would be good,0
7540,"But from my experience, nothing works better than traditional classes and actual conversations with Spanish peoples",0
7541,"The yellow box, the Instant Immersion tag, and the fancy packaging is all an illusion to look like Rosetta Stone",0
7542,This is not Rosetta Stone! But for the money this is a great set of additional training tools that work fine as a supplement to whatever other method you are using to learn Spanish,0
7543,"You won't learn to speak and understand conversations using just this product, you just won't, but as a bit of brush-up on the side it will help",0
7544,The games and iPhone MP3 files are useful,1
7545,The circa 1980s generic clip-art graphics is just sad,0
7546,"Andere is no real immersion, no real intelligence to the reparation or presentation, and again, I can only recommend if you are looking to use it as a supplement, not as a single-source language learning system",0
7547,"But for that daunting task, there really is something much better and cheaper than the much hyped Rosetta Stone - take a look at the Spanish Fluenz DVD's --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-Win-Mac-with-software-DVD-audio-CD-podcasts-and-Navigator-Learn-Spanish-with-the-latest-upgrade/dp/B000WHBK00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1 (Win/Mac) with software DVD, audio CD, podcasts, and Navigator",0
7548,Learn Spanish with the latest upgrade,0
7549,</a>&nbsp;They are muy bien!,0
7550,"Upon starting the software learning regimen, I found it easy to navigate and fun to learn",1
7551,"For all the negativity written about this software, I'd have to say those people are out of there minds",0
7552,What you learn is SPAIN Spanish,0
7553,"For what you get compared to the price, it's a no brainer! For those of us who did not learn rudimentary Spanish in school, this is a great product",1
7554,I come from a Spanish background never learning the language,1
7555,I didn't have the discipline to learn until now,0
7556,You really need to converse with other Spanish speaking people to get it to sink in,0
7557,Practice makes perfect,0
7558,I am already thinking in Spanish! Overall I'd say it's worth the investment,0
7559,Where else can you learn so much for so little? Wonderful product that is highly recommended!,1
7560,"I bought Immersion Spanish a few weeks ago, and when I uploaded the first cd to my computer, It was just that-instant",0
7561,"It has a male spanish speaker and a female spanish speaker, who pronounced the words each in different ways to give a clear understanding of how to pronunce the words",0
7562,"It has a clock like list of lessons: Firstwords, Food, Colors, Phrases, Countries, Shopping, Time, Numbers and Body on Cd 1 - you click on the topic you want to practice",0
7563,"After you practice, you can click on a word practice session or an Easy or Hard Game Session",0
7564,It has a Speaking Practice - where you can speak and listen to how you pronounce the words,0
7565,It also has a dictionary you can print,0
7566,"When I'm done with Level 1, I will progress to Levels, 2 and 3 of the other cds",0
7567,I think it's easy and to the point,1
7568,Great,1
7569,Can't beat the product for the price,1
7570,Only complaint is they don't tell you if this is a South American Spanish course,0
7571,There is nothing in the sales literature or the instructions,0
7572,I gambled on the course because of the price,0
7573,Street Spanish perhaps needs to be learned elsewhere,0
7574,"I found Instant Immersion to be ok -- I mean, it's no Rosetta Stone, but of course Rosetta Stone costs HUNDREDS of dollars -- so this is a GREAT value for what you get",0
7575,"I find that it's probably most helpful as a supplement for a beginning Spanish class,  if it's been a couple of years since your last class and your basic Spanish is rusty (like me), or if you just want to learn a few conversational phrases for a trip or to be able to communicate on a very basic level",0
7576,WAY more interesting than just having a book or a cassette,0
7577,"I would hardly call it ""immersion,"" however, unless they sent several Spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program!  (Which they don't",0
7578,")  ;-)

By the way, it's nice that it works on both PC and Mac",1
7579,I don't see that a lot with software (especially when it's fairly inexpensive),0
7580,"I started with disc 1, which reviewed vocabulary",0
7581,I really enjoyed playing the easy and advanced games at the end of the program,1
7582,"However, I had major problems with disc 2",0
7583,"After returning the product to the store and getting the SAME program ( I thought it was my computer), I opened disc 2 on another computer",0
7584,Although I could open the program,0
7585,I had trouble exiting the program and saving my scores,-1
7586,Disc 2 contains vocabulary to memorize but without the easy and advanced games at the end,0
7587,I found disc 2 to be very boring,-1
7588,Although disc 1 was fun and easy to use,1
7589,I DO NOT recommend buying this product,-1
7590,"There are a whole bunch of comparisons between this product and Rosetta Stone already, but I'll throw my two cents in",0
7591,"I've got both and found this product cheap, in every sense of that word",0
7592,"Rosetta stone was definitely the better product of the two, and was more what I'd call ""immersion",0
7593,"""

Instant Immersion is not immersion, it's mostly memorization (more so than Rosetta Stone)",0
7594,This is not a product you could really learn the language from,-1
7595,I'd say it's best use is for a student in a low level Spanish class to get a little more practice,0
7596,Also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp,0
7597,"for instance ""azul"" becomes ""athththul"" or ""azcar"" becomes ""ah-ffffu-cah""",0
7598,overall: this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other Spanish class,1
7599,"you almost certainly will not learn Spanish from it, at least alone",0
7600,"then again it would be hard to learn it solely from Rosetta stone, so at least this is cheaper",0
7601,"IN THIS AUDIO, YOU CAN HEAR THE LADY SWALLOW, BREATH AND EVEN HEAR THE SPIT IN HER MOUTH",0
7602,IT IS DISGUSTING ON ALL LEVELS,-1
7603,IM SURPRISED THEY COULD NOT DELETE THESE SOUNDS WHEN DOING THE FINAL EDITITING,0
7604,ALL I CAN HEAR IS HER TAKING DEEP BREATHS AND SWALLOWING VERY THICK SPIT,0
7605,EITHER THE LADY IS DEHYDRATED OR IS DIABETIC! EW,0
7606,I picked this product as a less expensive alternative to the allegedly more robust language software offered by Rosetta Stone,0
7607,"Since I had studied Spanish years ago, I thought this package might help me restore my former skill with the vocabulary, which always seemed to be my weak point",0
7608,"Admittedly, I failed to remember that since this is a CD-ROM, it runs from the DVD, and I wasn't expecting the program to run as slowly as it did",0
7609,"But my bigger problem was the interface, the lack of instructions (even rudimentary ones), and the blurred accents of the native voices that I was supposed to mimic",0
7610,"It's possible that this product might be appealing to small children, since it uses cartoonish characters",0
7611,"For me, after several hours of frustration, I decided I would have to try another approach",0
7612,"My daughter chose the Rosetta Stone-more bells and whistles but Instant Immersion Spanish
 is plenty for me as I try to learn Spanish",0
7613,I am glad I bought it,1
7614,"enjoy the Ipod program while on my daily
 walks and look forward to pursuing at my own pace on my computer without feeling intimated in a class room setting
and much cheaper too! I also have been very pleased each time I use Amazon",0
7615,"com-I checked other sites and this was
 best price and service",0
7616,"I wanted an easy way to learn spanish so that I could talk to my neighbors and some co-workers who prefer to speak spanish, but there wasn't any way I could afford the Rosetta Stone pricetag",1
7617,"And even though (from what everyone says) the dialect seems to be mainland Spain, I just want to pick up enough to carry on some useful conversations",0
7618,"I have learned a lot of vocabulary, and being around people who speak the language the speed of the use on some discs is not uncomfortable",0
7619,"I'm not crazy about the flashcard games, but then I don't like flashcrad games of any kind",0
7620,"For the most part I am enjoying using this system, and my friends who speak the language seem to appreciate the effort and have been helpful and patient with me",0
7621,"Naturally, a class would be better, and if I needed this for real in the business world that would be how I would go",0
7622,For my purposes it's working out ok so far,0
7623,"I'm considering the Italian version, but first I want to get this down a bit better",0
7624,I got this to help me pass my Spanish college class,0
7625,I love it! =],1
7626,This is a fairly typical learn by listening language system,0
7627,"It's not bad, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table",0
7628,There are very few people who can successfully learn a language this way,0
7629,Those who can will find it works just fine,0
7630,It has the type of dialog you would expect,0
7631,If you have tried other learn by listening programs you can expect the same results from this one,0
7632,Disclaimer: I am reviewing a copy I received for free through the Vine program,0
7633,"This is a good program and is worth the selling price, I think",1
7634,"You can read the other reviews, comparing it to Rosetta Stone's and other vendors' Spanish language programs",0
7635,"This is a little cheaper, but still does quite well, at least in the limited time we have spent with it (we have not gotten too far along yet)",0
7636,"As a homeschooler, I tried the language lessons available at the library (rosetta stone, then Mango, then Pimsluer, then back to Mango, then Muzzy,, then whatever I could find online, then flashcards) and it was like pulling teeth to get my daughter to sit down, do the work - see if she remembered anything (she didn't), and after a week or two, see if there was something else that would get the job done",0
7637,I purchased this only because it was cheap and through Costco so I knew that I could return it,0
7638,"After sitting around a week or two, we finally tried out the program",0
7639,My daughter will frequently stay on for a few minutes after the timer goes off,0
7640,She continuously begged me to buy the microphone so that she could do the speech part,0
7641,"On the weekend, she went on the program of her own volition to play the games instead of spending her half hour computer time on Webkinz",0
7642,She has been telling me all the words she can say in Spanish,0
7643,"If you look at my other reviews, you will see that I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews out",0
7644,This completely deserves five stars and more,1
7645,I think the big difference between this and the other language programs is the games that give points out,0
7646,It gives you a way to compete with yourself that is lacking in the other programs where your desire to learn the language is supposed to be the intrinsic motivation,0
7647,"An inexpensive ""try me"" alternative to the Rosetta Stone",0
7648,The Instant Immersion language series is based on the same learning principle as the Rosetta Stone:  Natural Learning,0
7649,It is based on the theory that we learn a language by repetition and continuous exposure to a language or environment,0
7650,Theoretically this is true,0
7651,"However, each person learns in a different combination of ways based on his/her previous experiences and therefore the way in which we learn develops as we age",0
7652,"How effective any program is, boils down to whether the method of teaching matches that individual's method of learning",0
7653,"This product contains a number of CD s for listening to role-play conversations and role-play games in Spanish on a specific subject, say buying a T-Shirt",0
7654,"In this script you will be exposed to words for size, colors, numbers and basic phrase such as ""I would like___"", ""Could you please give me___""

This product also contains a DVD which is essentially a number of photo-flashcards for word association",0
7655,This is only slightly more helpful than the CD s because you can see a video of a man and a woman taking turns speaking the language and you can mimic the way their mouths move in order to refine your pronunciation,0
7656,"In comparison to the Rosetta Stone this product is not as in-depth, comprehensive or as organized",0
7657,"It is basically a  ""light"" ""try me"" mini version of the Rosetta Stone",0
7658,"At this price, it is a good introductory program for both the learning method as well as Spanish vocabulary",0
7659,It does not contain as much grammar or sentence building knowledge as the Rosetta Stone series or the Pimsleur series,0
7660,It resembles a phrasebook set to CD,0
7661,"As both a Pro and a Con of this type of product: expect the Spanish version to be similar to the Italian version, the French version, the Japanese version etc",0
7662,Works well if you thrive with this learning method but is bad for those that are  bored easily,0
7663,"Recommended if
1) You always wanted to try the Rosetta Stone style of learning but are not sure you want to spend that much $ yet",1
7664,2) You are quite certain that flashcard style learning or audio role-playing works well for you and just want to experience the Spanish language,0
7665,3) You want to learn Continental Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish,0
7666,4) You want to have an Audio Phrasebook,0
7667,"I briefly tried Rosetta,  but at their price, I didn't want to risk buying something, which I had not fully tested",0
7668,So I bought the budget version: Immersion Spanish,0
7669,I was not that impressed with it,-1
7670,They save money by having cheap graphics (although I can't believe a few photos would be more expensive than their quick hand-sketches),0
7671,"It primarily teaches you vocabulary and phrases, which is helpful, but you need grammar, too, if you ever want to talk about your own ideas",0
7672,I may go back---  it's certainly helpful if you know no Spanish (like me),0
7673,"But in the meantime, I've found, on the Internet, the following:
1",0
7674,"Spanish Dictionary, with free Spanish lessons (It has great graphics",0
7675,And you can create your own flashcards with an automated audio for pronunciation),0
7676,"LoMas TV - Spanish Immersion TV, which costs $10",0
7678,It has videos with spoken Spanish by natives,0
7679,"But, in addition, it has English and Spanish subtitles underneath, and an instant dictionary, so that you can figure out what is being said",0
7680,This is real instant immersion,0
7681,"Both much better than 'Instant Immersion Spanish' and less money, too",0
7682,I have used Rosetta Stone and this product,0
7683,"I agree that neither are quite what they promise, which is an EASY way to learn a language",1
7684,For someone to compare this favorably to RS is highly suspicious to me,0
7685,"After multiple failed attempts to get this product to work on my Mac, I went to a PC laptop to actually check it out",0
7686,This product compares to Rosetta Stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak,0
7687,This is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list,0
7688,"Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone",0
7689,My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary,0
7690,"So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS",0
7691,"The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing",0
7692,"It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair",0
7693,They should take those claims off of their packaging,0
7694,"I'll be demanding a refund for the Mac incompatibility, but otherwise would make use of the money back guarantee",0
7695,Save yourself the hassle,0
7696,"I was thrilled to see Amazon present these, as I had wanted the Rosetta Stone version for years",1
7697,"Since I never used Rosetta stone, I can't compare, but I will say this was fun, but only for a few weeks",0
7698,"After the newness wears off, it didn't seem much different than the memorization needed by other types of language programs",0
7699,"Still, a  very inexpensive way to try a language out",0
7700,"I found listening to these CDs not fun, nor were they successful in teaching me Spanish",0
7701,"I thought it would be useful to pick up some of the language, but my ears just don't seem up for languages",0
7702,"This probably explains why I barely passed three years of high school French!  In fact, I chose my graduate school on the basis that they considered Fortran competence sufficient to meet their language requirement",0
7703,I like it but it seems more like a game than a real teaching tool,0
7704,The CD roms don't break down the language like I would have liked them to,0
7705,"They teach you the names for colors or objects but don't put it into a sentence for you, and I've learned that spanish speaking is backwards, so that doesn't really help speak the language",0
7706,The CD for the ipod is wonderful though,0
7707,"It really breaks down why the language is the way it is, that 1 cd is worth the price of the whole",0
7708,Hope this helped,0
7709,I bought it because I need some basic Spanish for a trip,0
7710,"I found it useful to have different methods of learning - audio, iPod, sentences, common phrases, matching games, guessing games and a video",0
7711,I think I got enough of what I need to travel to Mexico,0
7712,I was comfortable enough to understand the key words from what people were saying,1
7713,I did use the tech support site and found my answer in their online FAQ,0
7714,I even asked a question and got an email response in about 3 hours that contained useful stuff but also had links to the exact answer (PDF document),0
7715,"For my needs, I am glad I did not spend the money on more expensive products that would sit on the shelf when the trip was done",0
7716,"I have taken Spanish classes off and on over the years, but this is the first computer DVD set that I have tried (Many years ago I tried the Pimsler audio cassette series for French and really liked them)",0
7717,"I am pretty conversant in Spanish, having learned it mostly just from working with and around Spanish-speaking people over the years",0
7718,I found this computer-aided method of learning to not work particularly well for me,0
7719,"Even though I spend most of my time during work hours in front of the computer (or perhaps because of it), I found it hard to be engaged by this program",0
7720,"Some overall thoughts:

I personally found the user interface to be pretty clunky",0
7721,"It has a distinct ""Fischer Price"" feel to it with lots of blocky pictures and primary colors",0
7722,"I found the awkwardly animated ""talking heads"" to be more of a distraction and annoyance than a useful tool for learning pronunciation",0
7723,"I found it hard to understand what ""lesson"" I should be following",0
7724,"There does not seem to be a directly prescriptive path that the program wants you to follow, so you tend to spend a lot of time poking around and exploring, which might be entertaining, but doesn't lead to a cohesive and structured learning process",0
7725,"This is what I've always liked about audio CDs or cassette tapes - they are numbered, and you listen to them in sequence (usually accompanied by a workbook)",0
7726,"You *can* skip ahead if you like, but you always know where you left off and jumped ahead, making it easy to go back if you want",0
7727,"Using this program, I really felt ""lost"" a lot of the time",0
7728,"My 13-year old daughter is taking Spanish in school and LOVES it, yet I could not get her interested in this program at all",0
7729,I think she had the same problem I did - sitting in front of the computer just doesn't seem conducive to being able to focus on and learn a language,0
7730,"Bottom line, I think this product is adequate for ""refreshing"" yourself if your high school or college Spanish is a bit rusty, but I don't think it is designed in a way to be well-suited for learning the language from scratch",0
7731,"For an elementary or middle school kid, it might be a good accompaniment to their classroom work, as it is reasonably entertaining to use, and contains a lot of vocabulary drills and lessons, along with lots of phrases that you can learn",0
7732,I understand that there is a tendency to continue producing what a company thinks work,0
7733,Learning a new language or brushing up on your existing skill is tricky business,0
7734,"I learned a lot of Japanese learning in Japan, but it's not always possible to just go to a country to cement or start your language skills so I picked up the Spanish version",0
7735,The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything,0
7736,"I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version",0
7737,The graphics are dated and unattractive,0
7738,The videos/animation slow and not fluid,0
7739,This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate,0
7740,"I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing",0
7741,That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive,0
7742,The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded,0
7743,It doesn't look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all,0
7744,I still think these are interesting to start with if you don't have an old version,0
7745,"If you do have an old version and can get it to function properly on your current build, pass on these",0
7746,There just isn't enough new here to justify buying it again,0
7747,"This progress takes a lot of time to work through, but it is very helpful to develop conversational skills",0
7748,"It covers travel questions and answers, shopping, and day to day activities",0
7749,It builds one lesson to the next which is also helpful,0
7750,If you follow through the program you can learn converstaional Spanish,0
7751,"A person won't get fluent in a this language with this program, but it is helpful if you are unable to enroll in college courses",0
7752,It also is good to use between breaks if you are taking a college course,0
7753,It funtions well on the computer and I had no software issues with this program,0
7754,Takes a bit for slower computers to kick up the CD-ROM drive (I'd suggest loading this on you HD if possible) seems OK on computer with faster processor and CD-ROM/DVD drive,0
7755,"The first disks take a little fishing around with unlabeled tabs, but this could be intentional to get your mind into another space???

Fun and easy to use",1
7756,"includes flash card type games, lots of repetition of vocabulary and as much on pronunciation as you'd like",0
7757,"Covers general travel conversation, including medical emergencies and business",0
7758,A great start for starting to learn a new language,1
7759,"Can't beat the price!

Would suggest for students who are considering or will be taking Spanish in high school and/or college",0
7760,"It's good to familiarize yourself with the language, sentence structure, etc",0
7761,"before jumping in, and this is at your own pace",0
7762,"Is NOT Mexican Spanish, but Castillian Spanish!

Good to use if you are going to take a trip, as the basics are very helpful, even if shopping!!!

Great way to start learning Spanish and you'll find there is much cross-over to Mexican Spanish, Italian, Potugese, etc",1
7763,on your own if you go onto learn more languages,0
7764,Well worth the money,1
7765,Disc includes many Spanish words and phrases and lets you listen as well as see the words in print,0
7766,It allows you to take quizes and receive a score,0
7767,You can record the words in your own voice after listening to the words on the disc,0
7768,You will have to have a headset to do this,0
7769,"I don't think there's much I can add to the other reviewers here--there's lots of vocab, but not a lot of grammar",0
7770,The option to listen to vocab lists on an MP3 player is nice and convenient and lets me review while driving,0
7771,The flash cards are good reinforcement,0
7772,"I'm not finished with the whole set yet, but even when I get there, I'm certainly not going to be fluent--that's impossible, but I think this would be a great companion to a Spanish class",0
7773,"I don't think there is enough grammar to be a stand-alone course, though--I'd like to see more grammar lessons",-1
7774,"Bottom line: if you are trying to learn Spanish, go ahead and give this a try--at this cost you don't have much to lose!",0
7775,"I have used ""Instant Immersion Spanish Levels 1,2 & 3"" for several months now and it is a complete Spanish language program that can teach basic words and conversational Spanish, but it does require a significant commitment to be made by the user",0
7776,You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc,0
7777,"The program includes, in recommended order of use:

1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases",0
7778,It can also be downloaded onto an iPod,0
7779,The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run,0
7780,"These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod -
2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM
3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM
4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM
5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM
6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM
7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM

8) ""Talk More"" Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate
9) ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i",0
7781,"Nancy Drew, etc)

The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they don't really match the rest of the class",0
7782,"I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan",0
7783,"I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher",0
7784,"In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me",0
7785,"We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis",0
7786,"This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older! Start early and good luck!

CFH",0
7787,I purchased Rosetta stone Spanish Level 1 and completed it,0
7788,I was ready to purchase Level 2 but it cost so much I wanted to try Spanish Immersion,0
7789,Immersion is much simpler and is not comparable to Rosetta Stone,0
7790,It is good for learning nouns but no way could you learn the language,0
7791,For example in Rosetta Stone you say a word or phrase and if your pronunciation is good enough it accepts it,0
7792,At first I thought I pronounced words good enough but Rosetta Stone made me keep saying them till I got it correct,0
7793,"In Immersion you pronounce a word, it records it, you play it back and rate your own pronunciation",0
7794,"I like this langauge learning system MUCH better than other ones I've tried, such as Fluenz",0
7795,I have not tried Rosetta Stone (too expensive,0
7796,")

likes:
colorful, clickable graphics menu system
Excellent organization (colors, numbers, foods, phrases, etc",0
7797,")
both male and female speech examples for all",0
7798,Games are fun and easy to learn,1
7799,"Some games show how the word is spelled as well as spoken
works with Apple products, including ipod and iphone
professionally done

dislikes;
There is one bad recording for ""Hola"" on the DVD
Didn't automatically run upon putting in the disk- (have Windows Vista, had to manually begin install",0
7800,")

Am I actually learning the language? YES, at least the basics",0
7801,"Overall, this company is on the right track",0
7802,I have wanted to learn Spanish as a second language for years,0
7803,"I have used tapes, CDs and software, but I always found them boring and I didn't stick with them",0
7804,What is different about Instant Immersion Spanish is the fun you have while learning the language,0
7805,"While the approach used in this software is similar to other more expensive programs, it is less of an investment than if you bought one of the high priced programs and still comparable in quality",0
7806,For someone beginning to learn Spanish Instant Immersion Spanish is fun and effective,0
7807,It would rate this program a high value for the price,1
7808,Without a knowledge of Spanish I was able to skip all of the work to the end and get 90-100% on all the quizzes,0
7809,"If answers are multiple choice, then the correct choice is always much too obvious",0
7810,This makes it impossible to get good feedback on whether or not I'm actually learning anything,0
7811,I found myself making flashcards of the material and doing it myself,0
7812,"There is a satisfaction guarantee from the publisher on this product, and I will be sending it back",1
7813,Free Spanish flashcard software and literature I found on the internet was much more productive,0
7814,"I've taken a total of four semesters of Spanish divided up between High School and College, but after going three years without speaking Spanish, I needed to find a program to help me review before taking Fourth Semester Spanish at the senior college level",0
7815,I was disappointed in the overall structure of the software,-1
7816,"I thought I would learn more with each disk, and the phrases that are emphasized are more geared towards individuals who need to know Spanish on vacation or while studying abroad",0
7817,"The first two levels provide good vocabulary practice, but do not challenge the student to construct sentences",0
7818,"There are important Spanish basics, such as verb conjugation, that should be a major lesson in the first two levels",0
7819,"I felt like I was spending a bunch of time reviewing simple Spanish words, rather than learning to construct sentences",0
7820,"The creator of the software made some practice games to help the learning process, but for my level I've found the games are a bit too simple, even when I did not remember most of the vocabulary that was taught before the lessons",0
7821,A lot of what I learned from the software is something that I can figure out by picking up a Spanish-English dictionary,0
7822,"I needed more practice dealing with verbs, sentence structure, expressing feelings, and more in-depth practice with telling time",0
7823,"I hate to be so critical of the software, because it can be interactive (the games) and there is some variety between the disks",0
7824,"It is also colorful- graphics, sound, etc",0
7825,is pretty solid,1
7826,"However, for the price the software is originally marked at, I would invest in a e-book or even find some credible online tutorials if you are a student or someone hoping to learn Spanish for scholarly purposes",0
7827,"If you want to learn some basics, and practice in an interactive way to prepare for a vacation, a business trip or studying abroad, then this may be a good refresher in some important Spanish phrases you should know",0
7828,"In conclusion, the usefulness of this software depends on what you are looking for",0
7829,"Are you a student who needs to eventually become fluent and construct your own phrases? Or are you simply looking to learn the basic, everyday phrases? Your answer to this question will determine if you will find use in this program",0
7830,"Note: I have not looked over the DVD; I am just rating the disks and programs I have gone through; this is why, despite initial dissapointment, I am grading the software three-stars rather than two",2
7831,"You know, if you think you want to learn a language but are not sure, then Instant Immersion is a great place to start",1
7832,It doesn't cost a lot and it gives you in miniature what the big boys (Rosetta and TellMeMore) give,0
7833,You won't feel swamped likely and you will get a feel for what software language learning is like,0
7834,I sampled the Spanish version and I am asssuming the other languages offered are similar,0
7835,"Remember too, one learning source will not deliver fluency",0
7836,It's a long slog,-1
7837,Instant Immersion is a good way to start,1
7838,old version is better,0
7839,wasn't impressed,-1
7840,speech and dictation is too fast for a beginning spanish student,-1
7841,There are some things I like about this total package but when it is all added up it is a confusing mess that if used by itself could have you spending a lot of time memorizing specific phrases and hoping that the native speaker you're conversing with know the specific response that you've memorized already to understand,0
7842,"I've wrote an essay which probably noone will read so for those who just need some concise points:

What I like:
-The Level 3, Disc 1 (more below)
-The included Audio CD
-The price at $20 is reasonable

What I don't like:
-The lack of coheshion between the different CDs
-The absurd claims on the box
-The absence of grammar/sentence structures/verb conjugations in the computer program
-The use of 9 CDs/DVDs to market the program when it could all be contained on 2, possibly one disc",2
7843,"This is what you can expect to find on the different discs included, inclding their pluses and negatives",0
7844,"Level 1, Disc 1
This disc will teach you the basics of Spanish vocabulary, you'll learn some basic colors, numbers, body parts, food",0
7845,"It is the 2nd strongest CD in the set, don't expect to be wowed by the graphics, games, or highly research-validated advanced language immersive techniques",0
7846,"It's at a technological level of probably around 20 years ago and honestly was probably developed 20 years ago but has received a few ""real-life"" actors to make it seem polished, but after watching (and laughing) at the same over-exagerrated ""Si"" for correct answers I switched to the low-tech computer cartoon characters",0
7847,"The easy games are painfully easy, and the other games help you learn the vocabulary but all are basically the same game with different vocabulary words, so you'll get bored if trying to cram too much in at one time",0
7848,"Level 1, Disc 2
You'd expect this to be a continuation of what you learned in the first disc but you'd be wrong",0
7849,I think the person who decided what to put in the box saw this old language program laying around from 25 years ago and figured might as well throw another CD in,0
7850,"It has some more vocabulary which you can record yourself saying and 3 games (really just one game style formatted a bit differently) that you can pick out the picture to the vocabulary word, one of the main reason I bought the set was to learn more vocabulary but there really isn't much interaction with the program to learn the words besides looking at the pictures and then memorizing the word",0
7851,"And I'm not really sure who picked out the vocab words, I've never heard a Spanish person speaking about Igloos, so why would I want to learn it as a beginner?  And is professions we're given an orchesta director but not a firefighter or police officer",0
7852,"Level 2, Disc 1
This disc will teach you some common phrases and the alphabet, phrases you'll use at the airport, restaurants, around town",0
7853,As a beginner you'll want to learn some of these phrases and you'll be picking up vocabulary as well,0
7854,Unfortunately this might be the most boring way to learn,-1
7855,"You can listen to the phrase in English or your language of choice and then hear it in Spanish, but it is much more exciting to repeat the phrase into a microphone as well and then you can hear yourself say it, I suppose perfecting your pronounciation by doing it over and over again, provided you can objectively hear what you may not be pronouncing right",0
7856,"There are exciting multiple-choice quizes for most of the categories, but the 10 multiple choices questions are always the same (random order) so a category might have 20 phrases but you'll only be quized the same 10 questions over and over again",0
7857,"What scares me the most about this CD (and also Level 2, Disc 2 & Level 3, Disc 2 - which are structured identially only different phrases/categories) is that you can memorize 200 phrases but will only be picking up grammar, sentence structure, and other Spanish syntax by chance",0
7858,"For example, you'll learn how to ask ""How are you?"", ""Como estas?"" in Espanol but the background picture is of two men greeting in a very formal setting which would typically mean that ""Como esta?"" the more formal way of saying ""How are you?"" is appropriate, but no where on the CDs are you going to learn about Tu vs",0
7859,"Usted, sure you'll be understood but it's such a basic topic in Spanish (and without a direct equilivant in English) that I can't believe ""The COMPLETE Language Learning System"" doesn't have it clearly explained in some form",0
7860,"The other concern is you'll be learning phrases that use verbs in the form of the present tense, subjunctive, conditional, future, imperfect, and perfect indicative, but again no where on the CDs does it cover verb tenses, or even verb conjugations",0
7861,"So you might learn to say I want to go to the park, Quiero ir al parque, but after completing all the CD and memorize 600 phrases, not know how to say We want to go to the park, Queremos",0
7862,PLEASE don't think that this program alone will get you to any level beyond beginning Spanish skills,0
7863,"Level 2, Disc 2
This follows the exact same format as Disc 1, 200 more phrases and vocabulary, covering school, families, hobbies, computers, sports",0
7864,"Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization",0
7865,"Level 3, Disc 1
This is the CD I like, and honestly if they sold this alone for $10 and didn't claim you could reach all your language dreams and hopes, I'd give this 5 stars",1
7866,"Again, this is a piece of software in this set like Level 1, Disc 2 that just seems to be thrown in, it is probably a good 20 years old as well but what I like about this is it is more immersive, you'll want some vocab lists to play the games but you're not going to find any, you'll click the help button and it'll give you more help in Spanish and you're like a lot good that'll do me but it does for example it might tell you a sentence in Spanish to pick the black dog, presuming you don't know the word for black or dog you click the help button and it show you a picture of a car that is black and says, here is a black car, you brain hears negro twice finds the only similarities between the black car and the other pictures to choose from is that one is black, negro=black, you click, you're right, happiness and your brain makes the connection, with repetition the connection come quicker, that is some good brain learning theory on this program",0
7867,"One of the games gives you directions in Spanish and then you have to find it on a map and again unlike the same multiple choice questions on the other CDs that get boring after the first time it is different each time so you can actually practice listening to directions in Spanish and figuring out where you need to go (a very valuable skill if you ever plan on using that ""Donde esta el/la",0
7869,"There's also a little gameshow simulation that you can play against the computer or against a worthy opponent, again the multiple choice questions have enough variations that it doesn't get bored in like 10 seconds",0
7870,After finishing up the a few other things on the other discs this will be the only one that I'll come back to use,0
7871,"Level 3, Disc 2
I which this were more like the first disc at this level but it regresses to the Level 2 format",0
7872,"Yes we can record 200 more phrases and vocabulary, now covering business meetings, finance, and accounting!!  Woohoo!  If you buy it right off the website by itself it costs nearly $50!  So how lucky we are that we can now talk business",0
7873,"Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization",0
7874,"Then there are the other 3 other discs:
Talk More Ineractive DVD
This is Level 2, Disc 1 in a DVD format",0
7875,"Instead of using your mouse you can use your remote control, but I guess you can't record yourself speaking, but you can play the exact same multiple choice quizes now with a time limit, if you could play all the lessons at once it would be great as a sleep-aide",0
7876,"Who is Oscar Lake? Game
Admitedly, this is what intrigued me enough about this software program compared to the others",0
7877,Very few are going to finish this game because it won't appeal to the gamer or serious Spanish learner,0
7878,"The gamer will get frustrated with it archaic design, the point to click to move to this area or enter this room is not engaging and probably just frustate those who don't play video games because it isn't very intuitive",0
7879,The serious Spanish learner will get bored with fixed conversations and the amount of clicking in between the conversations,0
7880,I played for about 2 hours and found the most entertaining part where I could turn on the TV and see a picture of a piece of luggage and hear a recorded ad to buy that luggage,0
7881,It'll be a bored day for me when I figure out who is Oscar Lake,-1
7882,"The Audio CD
If you remember the beginning you'll recall this is something that I like",0
7883,"The audio CD has no direct tie-in with anything else, another stand-alone product that got lumped into the complete set",0
7884,"The audio CD is the only place you'll find grammar, verbs, pronounciation, even instructions on accent marks",0
7885,"This by itself would also get 4 or 5 stars, I'm guessing the workbook that they also have for sale probably parrells the audio CD",0
7886,I wish the software designed used the audio CD as their model because a lot of it could benefit an interactive visual context,0
7887,"I wish it was designed so that it could just pop into the average CD player, I don't think I'm going to go thru the effort to burn it onto a special CD so I can listen to it in the car",0
7888,I doubt most people will ever get to the audio CD which is disappointing because it has the most depth if you really want to learn Spanish,0
7889,"Conclusion:
I read the box and it says they've sold 2",0
7890,2 million units at a price of $49,0
7891,"95, that is over 10 million dollars!  And considering a lot of the programing they reuse with just different languages there is some serious dinero to be had in foreign language software",0
7892,Maybe all the real innovation is with Rosetta Stone they've made over 78 million dollars according to the Instant Immersion box),0
7893,"I'll use what I bought for what I can get out of it, not worth the hassle of returning it, but hope someday a more complete language program comes out that doesn't cost an arm and a leg",0
7894,"Instant Immersion/Euro Talk people if you're reading this hire some programming consultant and some language aquisition consultants before you market Instant Immersion:Level 1, 2, 3 & now 4 (super-advanced)",0
7895,This product is a brand name for a vendor who packages offerings from a third party without sufficient documentation to understand how best to take advantage of the software,0
7896,"To take full use of the software, you need to go to the support site of Topics Entertainment and download several PDFs which aren't named to correspond to the disks to which they refer",0
7897,The first disk contains a utility to install basic vocab to itunes,0
7898,"Clicking on the link just leads to an infinite loop that installs copy after copy of the same 150 or so library of sound bites, each being a single word or phrase",0
7899,"Again, it installs with errors that are not addressed in the readme or on the tech support web site",0
7900,I contacted tech support to get information about how this title compares to another of their titles,0
7901,"They sent a one line email telling me """,0
7902,they are separate programs,0
7903,""" Duh! Why would I want one title vs the other?  No response",0
7904,I guess you get what you pay for,0
7905,A fair vocabulary builder with little or no technical support,0
7906,"If you care who's on first and need help, look elsewhere",0
7907,I'd say this vendor saves you $500 over Rosetta Stone because they don't pay for advertising (their tag line) NOR technical support,0
7908,"If support is your thing, look else where",0
7909,"If you like to ride bare back, go for it",0
7910,"If you want a good introduction to the Spanish language, I think this program would be helpful to you",0
7911,It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product,0
7912,"Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject",0
7913,"Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:

I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive",0
7914,"There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation",0
7915,There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you,0
7916,"I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned",0
7917,"So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around",0
7918,It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop,0
7919,"With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem",0
7920,"There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant",0
7921,Many times I was guessing,0
7922,"It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving",0
7923,I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases,0
7924,"I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course",0
7925,Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way,0
7926,"The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered",0
7927,I'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years,0
7928,If you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that,1
7929,"Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable",0
7930,"But to actually learn to converse with Spanish speakers, I think you need something more",0
7931,"In my line of work, it's a great idea to learn another language, and Spanish being the main lingo outside of English in my area, the Instant Immersion program seemed like the ticket",0
7932,It may very well be,0
7933,If it WORKED,0
7934,"I don't want to stay how many times I put the various DVDs that come with this program in my computer, to bring up a program that did nothing",0
7935,I looked in the box: no instructions,0
7936,I went to the developer's website: no useful information,0
7937,I went to another Immersion-only website: no helpful links,0
7938,"Now this might be because I have a Macbook, and not a PC",0
7939,"But the program is supposed to be Mac-compatible, so what gives??

I may revise this if and when the developer gets back to me (so far, no replies, and with a program this problematic, that's not a good sign",0
7940,")

I give this two stars for what it MIGHT be like if I can ever figure out how to make this work, and of course, the bargain price",0
7941,But it ain't much of a bargain if it doesn't WORK,0
7942,I'll be glad to revise it if and when,0
7943,"Meanwhile, Rosetta Stone's looking better and better",0
7944,Now if it only they'd do something bout the price!,0
7945,"I can learn from this program, but I have to pay close attention",0
7946,The speakers (people) on the program do not speak very clearly,0
7947,It is almost as if they are trying to speak with a lisp or something,0
7948,Hard to understand,-1
7949,I bought this package thinking it was similar to Rosetta Stone,0
7950,"i liked Rosetta Stone, but don't believe it's comprehensive or rigorous enough to teach the basics of a language",0
7951,(not worth the price),0
7952,it's a great introduction to pronunciation of simple everyday words,1
7953,"it would be  great for a junior high school student taking the language in school with a text, but no way does it teach grammar",0
7954,it's a good supplement,1
7955,this software package was similar in that it did not teach any grammar & had no structured lessons in how to form sentences,0
7956,the only two disks i found useful were the first two which introduced many common words,0
7957,The rest of the disks were just haphazard phrases which might be good for intuitive learning but it was by no means in depth enough to learn the basics,0
7958,If you're a tourist trying to just get by for a few weeks this might be useful,0
7959,"but if you really want to learn a language, take a college course",0
7960,i would not mind if i had paid under 30 for this but i feel it's overpriced at 49,0
7961,this software is for the very beginners,0
7962,Even the level 3 disc 2 does not fligh very high,0
7963,you are not able to watch conversationnal videos like you do in other brands on the market in the same range of price,0
7964,"I tried to play the cd ""oskar lake "" and could not",0
7965,it sounds very complicated,-1
7966,I went to their website,0
7967,Nothing helpful,-1
7968,"The title on the ""Instant Immersion"" box asks ""WHY DOES ROSETTA STONE COST SO MUCH MORE?""

It is because ""Rosetta Stone"" is so much better than the ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" Program",0
7969,I am a Spanish and ESL teacher,0
7970,I have used both programs,0
7971,Rosetta Stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face,0
7972,You will be fluent in any language after using Rosetta Stone,0
7973,"However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion",0
7974,It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other,0
7975,You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar,0
7976,"How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40",0
7977,00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about,0
7978,Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program,0
7979,Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program,0
7980,I chose Instant Immersion Spanish for introductory level Spanish for my high school daughters,0
7981,They are in the process of working through it and enjoy it,0
7982,"As a consumer, the things you should know about this are the following:

* It is easy to use",1
7983,"* There is not much guidance about how to use it, but not much would be necessary",0
7984,"(Since you are being ""immersed,"" it's the same as if you were simply left in a Spanish-speaking country, and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the CD's from level to level",0
7985,")
* It does keep track of your progress as you learn, thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at Spanish",0
7986,"* For the price, it is an excellent program",1
7987,"To read a review of this curriculum and nine other Spanish programs available this year, see this site:

[",0
7988,"]

We use this product on an ibook, but it can be run on Windows as well",0
7989,"It is exactly what they are advertising on  TV!
It`s interesting, it`s fun and you really learn a lot as soon as you start!",0
7990,We have found Rosetta Stone Homeschool French level 1 including audio companion to be an invaluable tool as a homeschooling family for learning the French language,0
7991,"I highly recommend this set, especially for Homeschoolers!",1
7992,"So, I'm a really visual learner",0
7993,"Therefore Rosetta Stone (visual-based) should be much easier to use and learn with than Pimsleur (audio-based), right?? We are going to France and I wanted to learn French before the trip",0
7994,I bought this produce as well as a new copy of Pimsleur French Unlimited level 1,0
7995,"Rosetta Stone:
1",0
7996,"Easy to install
2",1
7997,"Lots of different ""types"" of lessons (reading, writing, speaking, grammar,etc",0
7998,")
3",0
7999,The ability to see the words and memorize the visuals,0
8000,"BUT also
4",0
8001,"I hate the little ""correct!"" sound that it uses",0
8002,You can't turn it off,0
8003,It's terribly annoying,-1
8004,My pronunciation is not very good because I can see the word and keep trying to pronounce it like it is spelled,0
8005,"When I speak into the microphone, the program hates my effort and keeps failing me
7",0
8006,All worked well until I hit Lesson #4,0
8007,"At that point, the pictures because vague and I wasn't quite sure what I was saying or why",0
8008,"I started worrying about verbs and rather than understanding grammar, just started memorizing things without understanding",0
8009,"Oh my, the ""correct!"" sound became an aversion stimulus by this time",0
8010,"Pimsleur:
1",0
8011,"Easy to install
2",1
8012,"Two types of lessons (listening and reading)
3",0
8013,"Because I'm not a good Audio-learner, I had to redo the lessons, sometimes 5 or 6 times
BUT also
4",0
8014,"My pronunciation got a LOT better because I was listening to the speakers and not looking at the words
5",0
8015,"I picked up enough of the grammar to understand what I was saying and recombine words and phrases rather than just mimicking them
6",0
8016,"This program doesn't attempt to ""reward"" you with that awful dinging sound

Bottom line?  I made it through Pimsleur French 1 (30 lessons) and am buying French 2",0
8017,I have found it much easier to use (DESPITE being a visual learner),0
8018,I quit at lesson #4 in Rosetta Stone,0
8019,"I do not want to go back to Rosetta Stone unless they can:

1",0
8020,Speed up the testing process,0
8021,"(A more rapid click and on to the next question)
2",0
8022,Eliminate the sound they use to indicate a correct response,0
8023,I'd recommend at least trying Pimsleur first - even if you are a visual learner,1
8024,Needed to provide a easy to use program for my nephew to learn French and Rosetta Stone delivered,0
8025,"Fast shipping, and quality merchant",1
8026,"Great value, would seek this merchant in the future for sales",1
8027,I did level 1 of Filipino and I thought it was basically worthless,0
8028,Maybe you have to complete all levels to be able to use something but level 1 will teach you nothing usuable,0
8029,What's amazing to me is how much money Rosetta Stone charges people for this software,1
8030,Buy Berlitz products,0
8031,They are a lot cheaper and more useful,1
8032,Not a fan,-1
8033,All the commercials are BS! If you want to learn Spanish take a class this is good for memorization ONLY!!!!,0
8034,"I have a graduate degree in Spanish and spent quite a lot of time developing interesting material to present to my undergraduate students but have little experience in teaching children, so I was excited about finding a program to further my daughter's knowledge of the language",0
8035,The Rosetta Stone Homeschool Spanish (Spain) program is very well designed and teaches both the spoken and written language in a way that provides useful vocabulary in real situations,0
8036,There is a lot of reinforcement through images and repetition,0
8037,"I do find occasional problems with editing where the written statement is not the same as the spoken one, plus some typos",0
8038,"There are also a few grammatical points that I have issues with, but they do have to do with the evolution of the language (I say 'adnde' in Spanish, but I don't say 'whence,' so I guess that I shouldn't complain",0
8039,)  The main problem with this program is that it's boring,-1
8040,"Some friends have asked about whether or not they should use it with their kids, and I've had to warn them that most children won't be able to handle more than 15 minutes a day",0
8041,"My daughter started out very excited, doing 45 minutes on the first day, then quickly got tired of it",0
8042,"If you can, form a play group that does games and music together in Spanish to support what your child can get out of Rosetta Stone",0
8043,"This course provides a base, but it's definitely not a complete answer to language acquisition",0
8044,"I could not install it, then it does not work",-1
8045,too many issues,-1
8046,never got the chance yo use it,0
8047,I have limited time to call service,0
8048,Beware: the shift key doesn't work on the Mac,0
8049,This substantially reduces the value of the program if you use Macintosh,0
8050,We have purchased 3 copies in order to aid actual conversations within the family in German to optimize the effectiveness of the program,0
8051,I installed this and had internet loading issues with the install,0
8052,Tried 3 times uninstalling/installing before I called the help line,0
8053,"We checked for some ""known"" software issues and then I was finally directed to a site to download a new installation program, something named TOTALe(TM)",0
8054,That worked and I was on my way loading the levels,0
8055,Only loaded Levels 1-3 to my PC to start with,0
8056,Now I start the first module,0
8057,First several lessons are pretty simple for language but I got several items wrong when I had to guess what the program was looking for,0
8058,Instructions were not helpful but I had the option of starting over and did that a few times,0
8059,The quirky thing is at several points in the lessons an error message pops and you go forward to the next lesson,0
8060,Whether this is based on prior scores or not I can't tell,0
8061,There's no error message text which makes for a frustrating time,-1
8062,I would have thought that for as long as this company was in business it wouldn't keep error messages secret,0
8063,As I progressed I noted that the lessons got more complex so I start each session with a review of the prior one before moving on,0
8064,They have a basic logic that builds on prior lessons so it is helpful to take them over,0
8065,I'll have to come back once I get to the higher levels but I am learning words and phrases,0
8066,"This 2012 Encyclopaedia Britannica is the only required ""book"" that I assign for my college course entitled American 20th Century Political History",0
8067,"The articles are reliable, scholarly and well indexed",1
8068,"The Encyclopaedia allows students to rapidly branch out from one topic to another, learning the connections along the way",0
8069,The audio and video selections also provide them with resources that catch their ears and eyes,0
8070,"What's more, at this price, it is, by far, the most affordable text that they will probably ever buy in college",0
8071,"And, unlike other textbooks, they will take this one with them after they graduate",0
8072,I am delighted with this product,1
8073,"And, I began reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica in hardback form in 1958",0
8074,This is a wonderful program,1
8075,I love it in so many ways,1
8076,Anyway that has the britannica encyclopedia I would say to you wonderful buy it is worth every penny,0
8077,The product works well,1
8078,But you do need alot of room on computer so that the product will work properly,1
8079,"However it does a great job providing needed info for essays, editorials, etc",1
8081,Great buy,1
8082,Good bang for the buck,1
8083,I purchased this because I liked the idea of having an encyclopedia set without taking up the space,0
8084,"When I recieved the software I did a full install, got to the screen offering the trial for Britanica Online and felt dooped",0
8085,"The software is extremely basic, for further information they want you to purchase the online access",0
8086,"This may be good software for elementary kids research for school, or general information browsing but definitely not for info junkies",2
8087,"The navigation of info and articles is strange, the atlas is very basic maps, the search function and results are cluttered and frustrating",0
8088,There are very few user preferences that you can change,0
8089,Overall I don't feel it was worth the $22 I paid for it,0
8090,"I would maybe purchase as a gift for someone without internet access, other than that I would pass",0
8091,Would happily build shelves for a whole set instead,1
8092,This is an appallingly poor quality product that will thrash Britannica's once reputable brand,-1
8093,The registration fails with an error,-1
8094,The DVD contents cannot be updated without registering first,0
8095,The promised free subscription to online content also requires registration,0
8096,"Even after registering directly on their website using the serial number and s/w recognizing me as the owner, it prompts me for my details again and fails",0
8097,That's just the start,0
8098,"The software has a 80's look about it, renders with jagged fonts, has poor navigation, inconsistent fonts and sizes, the inability to zoom the text, the inability to look up any word within the encyclopaedia",0
8099,and the list goes on,0
8100,"Unfortunately Britannica's decision to outsource this to a magicsw in India may have saved it some money, but has certainly cost its brand value",-1
8101,"For my encyclopedia source I will be using, Encyclopedia Britannica's Guide to Shakespeare",0
8102,I will use this source to obtain more information on Alfred Leslie Rowse,0
8103,"The section on Rowse has some critiques of his work, and as well as a general biography",0
8104,"It is not meant for well versed English scholars, because it seems to lack great detail",0
8105,It is a great reference point for general facts,1
8106,"The online encyclopedia has a wonderful chronology of the ""Shakespearean World",0
8107,""" I found this source by doing a simple Google search for more information on A",0
8115,"Don't be fooled, I have a real printed Brittanica encyclopedia and it is head and shoulders above this thing in quality and depth",-1
8116,Some articles in the real volumes have 10 pages full of information and pictures in comparison to 5 abbreviated paragraphs on the CD version,0
8117,"Also the ""childrens"" and ""teenage"" versions are needless baggage, who wants to look at a dumbed down version of the same document?  Kids, get used to the real world you can handle English",0
8118,"If you want a kids book, go read Barney & Friends",0
8119,"Anyway keeping my 1970 Brittanica set it has much more than the ""Ultimate Reference"" which is more like the ultimate indexed flash card set",0
8121,I had an earlier edition on my old computer so when I upgraded I decided to buy the updated 2012 Ultimate edition,0
8122,"I loaded it to my computer and proceded to register it to get available updates, the last step in the registration yielded an error message for 3 days in a row",0
8123,"After 3 emails to their tech support and no response, I bit the bullet and called the non-800 (312) tech support phone number",0
8124,"20 minutes on hold in 'queue position #1', I gave up, and went on to the leave a message for tech support -- the recording said they would get back to me in 2 to 3 business days",0
8125,Not acceptable,-1
8126,"Another negative is, that although I bought a new top of the line, very fast computer, this program loads slower than any program I've ever had",0
8127,So I called Amazon and said that I wanted to return the product because as far as I'm concerned the lack of support makes it defective,0
8128,"I won't buy from Britannica again, just stick with Wikipedia! Going to uninstall now, don't want it!",-1
8129,This software is garbage because you can't even register from it to get updates,-1
8130,I emailed the company and they claim to be working on a solution but in the meantime gave me some asinine solution that's too complicated to even deal with,-1
8131,ZERO stars until the company fixes this problem,-1
8132,"I've used the Britannica software encyclopedia since 1998, and my most recent edition was 2008",0
8133,decided four years was a good time period for an update,0
8134,"It seems like the software developers at Britannica are stuck--there really is nothing new about the arrangement, use or visual design of this program",0
8135,"While I'm glad to have updated articles and content, it would be nice to see some creativity and updating at work in the program design",1
8136,I had no problems installing or running the program,1
8137,"However, there is apparently a problem on Britannica's end with product registration",0
8138,The registration process simply leads to an error page,-1
8139,"And the program keeps prompting for registration; it is also not possible to reach the ""update center"" until registration is completed, so that's essentially not accessible",0
8140,Britannica technical support did respond relatively quickly that there are problems with the registration site,-1
8141,It would have been helpful to have this information on the technical support page,1
8142,"Also, I noticed that the maps in the ""Atlas"" part of this program are copyrighted 1998",0
8143,"Seriously, people?  Update the maps, already",0
8144,I bought this product for my mom so she and my niece could have something interesting to go through on evenings with grandma,0
8145,"My niece gets to satisfy all those, ""why?"" and ""what is a",0
8146,"?"" questions with vivid pictures and interesting facts and it's improving her reading skills and attention span without her even knowing it",0
8147,I highly recommend this product for the inquisitive minds in your life,1
8148,I like the videos and pictures,1
8149,There was alot of advertisements installed with the program though,0
8150,The writing of the ariticles in my opinion is so so,0
8151,Good for cross referencing information but often not comprehensive,1
8152,"Wikipedia often had more information, pointed me to more places to look, and seemed more professionally written",0
8153,I am sure this is not the case with all articles but I was surprised at how often this seemed to prove true,0
8154,"I also have Encarta, which I find more useful, because the dictionary offers the vocal pronunciation for whatever word is being researched and as far as I've been able to determine, Britannica does not provide this very pragmatic feature",0
8155,A register cleaner corrupt my Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2009,0
8156,"After trying to reinstall Encarta with the replacement disc, I soon found out that Microsoft Downloader is no longer provided and Microsoft no longer provides technical support",0
8157,After reading the reviews at Amazon I decided to purchase Britannica 20011 as a replacement,0
8158,The first thing I noticed is the lack of information on the disc as compare to Encarta,0
8159,Britannica offers Britannica Online with the purchase of their disc free for 1 year,0
8160,The catch is you must put your credit card up for future automatic billing,0
8161,You can cancel the service before your year is up without being billed,0
8162,"Britannica Online is much better than the disc but when you compare it with Encarta online, Encarta online was better",0
8163,"When searching to buy an encyclopedia on disc, there is not much to choose from",0
8164,My opinion Britannica disc is not even in the ball part with Encarta,0
8165,I am sorry that Microsoft has left the encyclopedia arena for more profitable ventures,0
8166,Britannica is the leader again by default,0
8167,I have been using the Britannica Online instead of the disc,0
8168,I believe Britannica could do better at providing information on their disc but will they,0
8169,"Bottom line, it is all about money but if you can afford Britannica Online service, it is better than the disc and remember you get one year free with the purchase of the disc",0
8170,"I've only looked up a few subjects on it so I can't really speak to the quality of information, but the interface is terrible, especially for an older computer",0
8171,My school computer is an older P4/XP machine,0
8172,"For the most part it does fine, even runs Office and whatnot",0
8173,"But running this encyclopedia on it is terribly slow and frustrating, especially searching",0
8174,"I don't doubt this is a great resource, and the value is great, just make sure you have a decent computer with lots of RAM",2
8175,And don't go by the system requirements listed either,-1
8176,"My computer easily meets and exceeds what they list, and I still have lots of problems with it",2
8177,"encarta, software, macintosh

Encyclopedia Britannica Ultimate is the best",1
8178,"The Encyclopedia Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition (formerly ""Student and Home Edition"") builds on the success of its completely revamped previous editions in 2006-10",0
8179,The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome,0
8180,"It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den)",0
8181,Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products),0
8182,"The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer)",0
8183,"All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content",0
8184,"In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature",0
8185,The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use,1
8186,"It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media",0
8187,"When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's ""search"" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge",0
8188,"Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy ""Virtual Notecards""",0
8189,Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace,0
8190,"The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move",0
8191,"Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections",0
8192,This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts,0
8193,These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements,0
8194,Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center,0
8195,"Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration)",0
8196,A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated,0
8197,"Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website",0
8198,"Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones",0
8199,It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content,0
8200,"Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks",0
8201,"Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature",0
8202,"About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings",0
8203,"The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words)",0
8204,"But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips",0
8205,This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright,0
8206,The Britannica fully supports serious research,1
8207,"It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia",0
8208,"It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy",0
8209,"The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields",0
8210,The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community,0
8211,The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches,-1
8212,Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form,0
8213,"This is why the Britannica incorporated the ""Personal Brain"" to cope with this predicament",0
8214,But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively,0
8215,"The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, ""how to"" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials",0
8216,"Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals",0
8217,It provides unequalled coverage of its topics,0
8218,"Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly",0
8219,"The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately)",0
8220,"Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review",0
8221,"There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies",0
8222,Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles,0
8223,The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet,0
8224,"Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site",0
8225,"The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web",0
8226,"The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced",0
8227,"The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others",0
8228,Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage,0
8229,A seamless experience is in the cards,0
8230,"Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface",0
8231,"Some minor gripes:

The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated",0
8232,"Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?

Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications",0
8233,This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks,0
8234,"If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best",1
8235,But that's it,0
8236,Don't think twice,0
8237,Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now,0
8238,"It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate)",1
8239,"For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom",0
8240,"With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference",0
8241,"Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self-love: Narcissism Revisited""",0
8242,I installed the software on both  Mac 10,0
8243,4 and Win 7 machines and it works well,0
8244,Recommended,1
8245,"Not sure if Amazon is throwing in a ""free"" year of the Britannica online service",0
8246,"Also, the Britannica website currently has a 20 percent off promotion",0
8247,"I'd rather use the free Wikipedia, because that at least has more articles and even better info most of the times",0
8248,I purchased a copy of Britannica 2011 Ultimate Reference,0
8249,Installed it,0
8250,"However, everytime I try to submit a registration, when the software starts, it gives me unknown apache error and the entire invested time to complete the tedious registration form is quixotic, time wasting because when I open the slow loading program the next time the NAGGING REGISTRATION SCREEN POPS UP AGAIN!!!!! I attempted to return the software to the electronic store, but it wasn't accepted back because it's a ""software"" I LOST MY MONEY :(( I will never purchase anything from Britannica again!!!! Nor I will condone anyone, students, employees, and adherents of mine to ever invest into Britannica's products",0
8251,"And all of these positive reviews, imho, are fake! to keep the ratings up for marketing purposes",0
8252,I have been buying this for years now as a basic research or reference tool and it is still pretty good,0
8253,Its better than i thought,1
8254,"You can practically find any article on topics that you haven't dreamed of!! the information you get is clear, well organised and gives you a broader picture",0
8255,"I own several different versions of Britannica software and although Wikipedia is more informative, I continue buying it to help with development costs",0
8256,"However, I do believe that certain aspects need to be improved to make this product better - or it will disappear despite of its long and proud history:

1",0
8257,Their pricing policy is very inflexible,1
8258,"I bought v2010 for about $40 and while I was still waiting for the item to arrive, they released the new v2011 and made me a ""special discount"" offer (one intended for loyal customers) for the unbelievably low price of",0
8260,"This kind of attitude does not make me feel ""valued""",0
8261,"If you know that you will be releasing your new version soon, either offer it for free to people who bought it recently, or sell it at a seriously discounted price",0
8263,"Try looking for the same information in Britannica and in Wikipedia, and you will find out that the information in Britannica is - by comparison - quite limited, there aren't enough pictures, links, etc",0
8264,Biography articles often do not include a picture of the person for example,0
8265,"Other articles include videos, but they are outdated and strange",0
8266,"I live in Varna, Bulgaria - a beautiful city on the Black Sea coast - and Britannica has always included video information on it which is probably 20 years old, taken from a strange location and containing factual and misleading information",0
8267,One may argue that a single DVD disk cannot contain current video footage on all geographical locations but in the era of Google Earth what Britannica has to offer is sometimes beyond inefficient,0
8269,It seems that Britannica editors take quite some time to include information on a renowned person in it,0
8270,"Type in ""Tarantino"" and you get an article on",0
8271,"""tarantella"" - ""a couple folk dance of Italy""",0
8272,"I wonder what should one achieve to be finally included in Britannica's ""Ultimate Reference Suite""? Google search has the answers that Britannica does not - and it is free",0
8274,A postal card for registering the software - by mail! - is included with your purchase,0
8275,Britannica views itself as an 18th c,0
8276,product that just happens to be on a DVD,0
8278,When you buy the DVD they cannot issue you an invoice,0
8279,"Here is what they wrote to me: ""We do not issue invoices as the order system that you have used is for consumer sales only",0
8280,It is not for use by companies,0
8281,There are a couple of problems here,0
8282,The first is that the software that you have purchased is only sold with a single user license and so we do not allow the purchase of this by a company as a company is not an individual,0
8283,The second problem is that we do not issue invoices for these orders,0
8284,Only the receipt that you should have received already,0
8285,""" OK, I used their site to buy their software, they allowed me to enter my company's name in the corresponding field, and then, all of a sudden, I cannot get an invoice",0
8286,"The argument about the licensing issue is just laughable - I own about 40 software titles and all have been bought with invoices, it is only Britannica sales that feel special in this respect",0
8287,"I said, I am buying Britannica out of the goodness of my heart, and all I ask for in return is that the invoice is issued in my company's name so as to claim back $4 in taxes - but, no, they will not do it",0
8288,That is very regrettable,-1
8289,It is also bad customer service,-1
8291,"Speaking of bad customer service, they never sign their emails to customers",0
8292,"I am signing my name, and the person (or people) I am communicating with are always faceless, have no names and remain hidden behind the neutral phrase ""Britannica Customer Service""",0
8293,"Have good business practices never reached Britannica?

7",0
8294,This is a major drawback: Britannica does not download any updates to your HDD,-1
8295,"They are made available through a special tab, but they are separate from what you have initially bought and Britannica likes to keep it that way",0
8296,This is very inconvenient,-1
8297,"The updates cannot be searched through the normal encyclopaedia search, so they are not truly accessible, unless you would like to search two times for every item",0
8298,"I like running the software (although it takes a fairly long time to start), going through the different options, reading the articles",0
8299,But I like all software and using dictionaries is what I do for living,1
8300,"If you are OK with the shortcomings listed above, I can recommend buying Britannica",0
8301,I was needing a definitive source rather than just using the internet and wikipedia to do research,0
8302,I also noted that the APA citations are at the bottom of every article,0
8303,"So it makes citing your sources really easy, just cut and paste",1
8304,No more using the INK book to figure out how to properly cite a source,0
8305,It is not a complete encyclopedia and most of the articles are very short,0
8306,"However, it does give you other sources to seek out and get a more detailed explanation",0
8307,"I am disappointed that Lewis ""chesty"" Puller is nowhere to be found in the encyclopedia",-1
8308,"Of all the great war time quotes, his are at the top of the list, he is also highly decorated and was involved in 3 plus wars",0
8309,"So I am sad to say that Britannica did forget something, or maybe they forgot it on purpose, I am not sure",0
8310,Overall good purchase,1
8311,I love this Britanica DVD,1
8312,The whole thing can install on your computer if you have the space,0
8313,"I love the print Britanica encylopedias, because they contain more comprehensive articles than others",1
8314,"Prior to using this DVD encyclopedia I used Encarta 2005, I think, and it was not nearly as comprehensive as this dictionary",0
8315,"I love this software Encyclopedia, and in my opinion, everyone should own a encyclopedia set and this is a very affordable and space saving solution",1
8316,Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition Is a good and fairly quick electronic encyclopedia,0
8317,Much of it though is useless to me,-1
8318,"What adult really cares about the elementary library for example?  Also, I don't see the point of ""The Brain"" which just looks like a fancy flow chart",0
8319,"I wish Britannica would focus on more specialized encyclopedias, and not these one size fits all editions",0
8320,More detail would also be nice,0
8321,but for basic information it is there and accessible,0
8322,Use this only as a starting point for your research,0
8324,"the encyclopedia brittanica is okay ! it has 3 encyclopedias, 1 from children but, I like the old 2003-2004 version better than this one but so far",0
8325,and it also has a dictionary which is good for college students,0
8326,"It's not a bad electronic encyclopedia, I just feel like Britannica has gotten a little slack in there detail writing on topics in recent yrs",0
8327,"My dad has a complete set from the 1890's and the articles were much more in depth back then, It's not just Britannica though others have gone the same way",0
8328,"However this is great for school aged kids which is what I really got it for, it has a separate  library for them that is aimed at their age groups",0
8329,If it was a little more in depth I would have given 5 stars,0
8330,Coming from Encarta 2007 this is a huge upgrade,0
8331,From what I've seen the articles are very detailed,0
8332,"The ability to open multiple articles and switch is great, and something I'd been looking for",0
8333,Britannica allows you to switch the level between adult and certain grade levels and it's actually useful,0
8334,The same search results in slightly different versions,0
8335,Hands down worth the money,1
8336,I feel like I can research anything and do it efficiently,0
8337,I am more skeptical than the day is long and believe little of what I read,0
8338,I had few choices for Hebrew and gave RS a spin,0
8339,I was stunned at its effectiveness!  I have a knack for language but felt out of my comfort zone with an Arabic base,0
8340,"I just did it and after the first in-person tutoring session, opted for the complete package",0
8341,I dutifully take an on-line lesson each week - but it is still a bit uncomfortable,0
8342,"Regardless, I am a satisfied customer and have used Babbel and Duolingo",0
8343,Rosetta is bettah,0
8344,I am very pleased with the Rosetta Stone format for language learning,1
8345,I now believe it is possible for me to learn Hebrew via this program,0
8346,"Prior to this, I didn't think I could learn such a different language, especially as an adult",0
8347,It is possible !!!! Shalom !,1
8348,"People have been praising these programs for a while now and I can understand why, but I think an exception has to be made for the Hebrew version, and I'll explain",0
8349,I purchased this back in January of this year to prepare for my up-coming trip to Israel in June,0
8350,I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this,0
8351,"In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English",0
8352,"Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program",0
8353,So here is what I do not like about it,0
8354,"I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well",0
8355,"When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet",0
8356,It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own),0
8357,"I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it",0
8358,"To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew",0
8359,"With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less",0
8360,"As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it",0
8361,"I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English",0
8362,The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes,0
8363,I was really excited about that until I played them,1
8364,All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them,0
8365,"Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is",0
8366,It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed,0
8367,You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it,0
8368,"And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating",0
8369,I don't know how anyone could find that useful,0
8370,"After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's",0
8371,"Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time",0
8372,The Rosetta Stone Hebrew Level 1 is a beneficial software program for those who are studying in the ministerial field,0
8373,This step-by-step tool provides the necessary tips for absorbing a new language and is a fantastic learning tool,0
8374,I will consider learning other languages with this program,0
8375,The Product is amazing,1
8376,the only problem is it didn't go over the basics like alphabet and number first,0
8377,I am amazed at how much i have learned still via this product,1
8378,Only bad part is my computer crashed and i now own a Mac,0
8380,Rosetta Stone is the easiest way to learn a language at home,1
8381,"I've learned several languages, but home study programs never really worked for me",0
8382,This one is an exception,0
8383,It really helps one to start thinking in the native language,1
8384,I highly recommend this program,1
8385,"After the initial difficulty of figuring out how to use the program and make progress, I got to enjoy it more",1
8386,Haven't finished yet,0
8387,This could not be a stand-alone method,0
8388,You'd have to read and learn verbs and other structure,0
8389,"But a very attractive compination of pictures, the printed word, hearing and repeating audio, and learning to remember from the sound or picture how to write the answer",0
8390,Very good!,1
8391,Make sure you get the latest version - the box set that was shipped was multiple versions past and I had to have several conversations with Rosetta customer service to get a workable version download,0
8392,This after the CSR somewhere overseas wanted me to give them permission to direct access to my computer???? Took multiple calls to get this sorted out because the updated download code I was promised never arrived,0
8393,I love this product,1
8394,I live in germany so learning german helps me to communicate with the people around me,1
8395,It's really easy to understand and the way you learn its easy to pick up really quickly,1
8396,I promised my wife I would learn her native language and now that I have retired I have time,0
8397,"Great teaching method
just as promised glad I brought this and I will also be purchasing a Spanish course after mastering German",1
8398,"My husband used both Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur and, hands down, Pimsleur is better for conversational purposes",0
8399,"For instance, Pimsleur employs different speakers and encourages you to make up your own responses",0
8400,Don't believe the hype from the airport kiosks,0
8401,"&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pimsleur-German-I-Comprehensive-CDs-Second-Edition/dp/0743518365/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pimsleur German I Comprehensive CDs, Second Edition</a>",0
8402,I love the Rosetta Stone system of learning German! The pictures are modern and they are combined with words and phrases in both a written and speaking format,1
8403,There is also an audio companion to help practice using a CD player or IPOD,0
8404,There are fun stories and games at all levels so you can practice what you are learning,0
8405,I am really excited about it and feel I have already learned more with this system than with any other lessons that I tried,1
8406,I would highly recommend the Rosetta system of learning a new language!,1
8407,I attended a private school when I was younger and had 2 years of German language,0
8408,"Later, I switched to a public school and the language receded into my subconscious since I had no one to communicate with",0
8409,"Throughout the years, I made several attempts to re-learn the language and gave up in frustration",0
8410,"I wanted to be able to think in German again, but the teaching methods created a translation process in my mind",0
8411,"Finally, I decided to give Rosetta Stone a try and have completed levels 1 through 3",0
8412,"This program helps build a solid foundation of the language because you are learning through association, not translation",1
8413,The lessons help you develop both spoken and written language,0
8414,"As I progressed with the lessons, the content made sense and I found the Adaptive Recall sessions to be extremely helpful in retaining what I had learned",0
8415,I also noticed significant improvement in my comprehension and understanding of the language,0
8416,"And, when exposed to German (outside of the software), I was naturally isolating unfamiliar words and determining the context to accurately interpret the meaning",0
8417,(Which I later verified by looking up the unfamiliar words,0
8418,")

The only negative that I found with this program is with the voice recognition technology",0
8419,"It works well for the most part, however it has not been perfected yet",2
8420,It works by comparing sound patterns,0
8421,"So if the native speaker uses a different tone or speed for a particular phrase, you must replicate that exactly or the software won't recognize that it's correct",0
8422,Sometimes I pronounced a phrase precisely and had to endure several frustrating attempts for the software to acknowledge this,0
8423,"Other times, I said the wrong phrase, but the software considered it correct because the tone and speed matched the native speaker",0
8424,"(For example, the phrase was informal ""Was machst du gern"" but I said formal ""Was machen Sie gern""",0
8425,")

I was so pleased with the results of this program that I later bought Rosetta Stone Italian levels 1 through 3",1
8426,"I highly recommend Rosetta Stone for building a solid foundation of a language and if you would like to think in that language, rather than have a translation process in your mind",1
8427,Please don't take offense the title of this review,0
8428,I just wanted to get your attention,0
8429,"I do not claim to be smarter than you, just more expert in foreign language teaching and learning",0
8430,Full disclosure: I have taught French since 1967,0
8431,"My first issue with this product is that the sequence of lessons, suitable for Romance Languages (I found Italian and Spanish very useful), works much less well for German",0
8432,German is not  Portuguese or French,0
8433,"It, like Latin, has three genders",0
8434,Nouns are declined,0
8435,"The agreement of articles and adjectives with nouns is, initially, quite daunting",0
8436,"As a result, Rosetta Stone German lesson presenting elementary concepts frequently require the learner to employ more advanced words and forms with which he/she is unfamiliar",0
8437,That makes a correct response practically impossible,1
8438,A recipe for frustration? Obviously,0
8439,"Why do it this way? Because that order of presentation works so great for French, of course!

I have already studied German (that was 48 years ago, but I still recall a ton, although I don't know where my keys are), so this program is fine for me",0
8440,i know where the bodies are buried,0
8441,"This is by way of warning you that you had better have a firm grasp of English grammar, or be a language professor, or be exceptionally adept at language learning, or you will never use this application after an initial, disillusioning try",0
8442,"Technically, I've found minor glitches during the first couple of hours of use: e",0
8443,", instead of the sequence prompt - time to answer - verification, one lesson has time to answer -prompt- verification",0
8444,"Minor, but initially confusing to me, who have written many language exercises",0
8445,"What would a novice would make of it?  Not very much, you can be sure",0
8446,"The worst thing about Rosetta Stone products is that the company sees itself as an adversary of language learners, not an ally",-1
8447,They are offensively defensive over their intellectual property,0
8448,"To study Italian, I had to schlepp around a fragile DVD from home to work to weekend home",0
8449,Spanish was fine,1
8450,But installing German has been pure torture: Rosetta Stone is not allowing me to install German in Princeton for weekend use,0
8451,And Rosetta has intentionally or accidentally created an infinite loop: you are told that you can use some of the features without registering the product,0
8452,Just try! Prepare to be enraged,0
8453,Rosetta Stone throws around nickels like manhole covers,0
8454,Prices are way high,-1
8455,Substandard language teaching techniques abound,0
8456,"Hire a first-rate teacher for each language, not just clueless native speakers",0
8457,"Were I running the show, I would work much harder on making my software perfect and my customers happy",0
8458,We've all seen how Apple does it,0
8459,Rosetta Stone is technologically on the right track,0
8460,"Pedagogically, not so much",0
8461,"These are computer people, not language teachers",0
8462,"Otherwise, they would never  fail to approach each language as a unique challenge to learners; a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach respects neither the language nor the student",0
8463,I have no better suggestion than Rosetta Stone for learning materials for German,0
8464,"Beginners, buy only level one",0
8465,"If you can work with it, good for you! Buy the whole course",0
8466,It's wonderful to learn a new language,1
8467,"I seriously doubt, however, that one student in ten will be able and willing to stick it out to the end of the first level",0
8468,And that is a terrible shame,-1
8469,My 4year old son is learning well as I had hoped,0
8470,his dad is spanish and he could not translate to his son since his dad only speak spanish  but since this order come to our home it help his dad and our son both ways,0
8471,I am very pleased with hook on phonics thank you so much for sending it very fast,1
8472,I bought this item for my 6 year old nephew and he will actually depart from his favorite shows to learn Spanish on the computer!  He has a lot of fun with it and likes to incorporate his new Spanish words into his regular conversations,0
8473,He was learning from the very start,1
8474,Great product!  Thanks Hooked on Spanish!!!,1
8475,"Both my daughter and I are born students, so we think the ""fun"" factor of this set is a 5-star",0
8476,I recently purchased this set for my just-turned six year old daughter to support her continued learning of the language,0
8477,"We have found this set to be a high quality, excellent learning tools that are well-thought out and well-executed for this age range",0
8478,"The learning is basic yet provides appropriate and seamless supporting materials (flash cards, workbook, story book)",0
8479,"In my experience, sticker charts are popular and encouraging to this age group and the vocabulary pace (colors, numbers, shapes, etc",0
8480,) is the perfect entre into encouraging the young student without frustrating them,0
8481,"My daughter was easily able to navigage the software, despite having had minimal exposure to computer games up until this point",0
8482,"The graphics were engaging and smooth, even on our nine year old Dell Dimension PC",0
8483,"This set alone is NOT going to create a fluent speaker, obviously; the lessons are too basic",0
8484,"However, there are many, many excellent skills and lessons to be learned by just sitting down and completing one 15-minute lesson per day/week, etc",0
8485,"Not only are there benefits to learning to speak and think in another language and appreciate another culture, but the act of simply sitting down and seeing that learning can be fun has many benefits as well",0
8486,Doing this on a regular basis also sets the stage for homework that begins in the first grade,0
8487,"That said, it's like anything",0
8488,it IS what you make of it,0
8489,"Not all children may be patient enough to sit down and be engaged by a task that seems ""educational",0
8490,""" And not all adults are able or interested in using the supporting materials with their child",0
8491,"However, just on it's own merits, the CD-Rom does an excellent job of incorporating gameshow type fun and practice sessions that are just the right length (not too long) in order to keep the young set still interested, even wanting to come back for more",0

8493,"It took me a while to finally open the product and download it on my computer, I took a couple of lazy days off",0
8494,"Anyway, When I finally did download it for my 4 year old daughter, whe really seemed to like it",0
8495,I must emphasize that it is very basic,0
8496,"It goes over the numbers, letters, colors, and common words, all which my daughter is familiar with",0
8497,"After learning the word, they can play a game, incorporating the word into the game",0
8498,"This was too confusing for her, so we skipped that part",0
8499,"Otherwise, its a good program for beginners",0
8500,Cannot speak highly enough,0
8501,My 4-year old loves the interactive CD-Rom program,0
8502,"Based on our success with the Spanish curriculum, I've decided to invest in other Hooked on Phonics materials",0
8503,I learn a language best by starting off really small,0
8504,Like kids version small,0
8505,"So, I got this, and it worked the way I wanted it to",1
8506,It was perfect for someone older just learning Spanish for the first time too,1
8507,Cause really when do learn languages we all feel like we are five years old in it,0
8508,I'm planning on passing this down to my neices some time,0
8509,The there was no way to mark your progress on the CD program itself,0
8510,"The map was fine, but some times pending on the situation we'd like a little more",0
8511,The other thing is that the books themselves a,0
8512,"a readers were NOT in Spanish! You had to stare at the back of the book, and then go from there",0
8513,I mean come on,0
8514,"They could change it to Spanish so that we can at least have the kids see how to compare the languages, and then to use them as they progress through Spanish",0
8515,what gives with that? I did like the cat thing though,0
8516,I think this program is wonderful,1
8517,It was just what I was looking for,0
8518,"I have a 3, 5 and 7 year old and it works for all of them",0
8519,I don't feel that the program is too simple at all,-1
8520,It is a basic level and I am learning along as well,0
8521,I really like the computer program so my children can work on their own,1
8522,The flash cards are also handy for a quick review anytime,0
8523,"I will be purchasing more Hooked on Phonics programs in the future!

I should note that I purchased at Big Lots for about $20 and I have seen it on sale in some of the other stores for this price",0
8524,Honestly I would pay the full price as well,0
8525,"I have purchased Hooked on Phonics to teach the kiddos to read and it was perfect!

I had such a good experience with Hooked on Phonics that I thought I would give this Spanish set a try",0
8526,Mistake,-1
8527,"Hooked on Phonics needs to stick with what they do well, teach phonics",0
8528,":)

I tried using this one time but realized that my kids watching Dora the Explorer has taught them more Spanish than this will",0
8529,I can't even give the unused set away on Craigslist,0
8530,"Seriously, don't purchase this",-1
8531,or at least check Craigslist and someone might give you their trash,0
8532,I expected more of a spanish immersion series with songs and activities,0
8533,This course material is mostly in english with few spanish items at end of each course,0
8534,Also the CD is only for Windows systems,0
8535,It will require some extra software if you want to run on a Mac,0
8536,"I bought this for my kids to introduce them to Spanish and we all love it! I thought they wouldn't like it because it is Cd-Roms and not DVDs, but they ask to do their Spanish lessons every day",0
8537,The work book gives great suggestions on practical application lessons that are fun for the whole family,0
8538,My son likes to do the dvds from time to time,0
8539,I think mainly because they're not too taxing,0
8540,"You hear (and possibly learn) a few Spanish words, but mainly it's just cartoon characters talking",0
8541,The books are in English,0
8542,Not sure what the point of them is in a set that is supposedly teaching you Spanish,0
8543,We live in Arizona and though I don't speak Spanish I knew all the words in here simply because they're so common,0
8544,I really feel like this was a waste of money,-1
8545,"A really great set for introducing your kids to Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spanish-for-Kids-Los-Animales/dp/B000XULOPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spanish for Kids: Los Animales</a>&nbsp;There are several dvds",0
8546,They're all in Spanish but easy to comprehend even if you don't know any Spanish,0
8547,There is not much out there for teaching spanish to kids,0
8548,"Everything focuses on number 1 thru 10, colors, food, and greetings; which is not learning a language in my opinion",0
8549,"At least there is a little more dialogue in this and my 4 Yr old seems to be able to navigate the program easily, it does get really repetitive but not on the Spanish, instead there is the same English introductions which tend to drag on and cause boredom, and you cannot click past them",0
8550,It did work on my Windows 7 system with no issues,0
8551,There are also story books in English included?,0
8552,This is a great way to teach your child Spanish,1
8553,"Unfortunately, I got so excited about teaching my son Spanish and learning it myself that I bought this way before I would be able to use it with him",0
8554,"But it is very fun and colorful, great animation",1
8555,"very remedial, but if you have ZERO Spanish Language exposure, remedial is perfect",0
8556,My 7 y/o likes it even though he knows the basics already,0
8557,"I like it because he gets practice following directions as well as organizational practice like going from workbook, to DVD, to activity - we do it together, but he ""leads"" the lessons himself",0
8558,This Hooked on Spanish kit is perfect for my Preschooler,0
8559,He asked to learn Spanish and this was the first thing I tried and he really learns a lot of words with it,0

8568,"BUT IT IS REALLY GOOD TO TEACH SPANISH,BUT TO A OLDER,AND MORE ADVANCED CHILDREN",1
8569,I bought this as well as Jump Start Spanish,0
8570,"Although Hooked on Spanish is very useful, it's much harder to get the kids to use it compared to Jump Start Spanish as it's kind of dry",0
8571,But I'm still glad I bought Hooked on Spanish because of the flash cards and the way it builds on itself,1
8572,"If you have to choose one, I'd recommend Jump Start Spanish since my kids really enjoy that one and actually ""want"" to play it all the time",0

8574,Grateful to have a new place to house my Family Tree,1
8575,I am just a simple person who has used RootsMagic over the years and upgraded as they were available,0
8576,Version 6 is my favorite,1
8577,"Sure the newer versions continue to bring me more and more bells and whistles, but Version 6 meets all my needs",0
8578,"If you are just getting started, you will find this program easy to learn and use, yet powerful enough to keep you going for years",0
8579,If you have been doing your family tree for awhile you will appreciate how well thought out the menus and options are,0
8580,I can't really compare to other programs because I have used this company for years,0
8581,I have no business connection with RootsMagic Company,0
8582,"Gift for a relative; I've used RootsMagic 6 (& now 7) for 2 years & find it easy to use, graphically pleasing, & completely satisfactory",0
8583,"You can also get a trial copy for free; the same goes for many other genealogy software, so it's easy to choose which one you like",0
8584,It was just as expected for some new users,0
8585,Thank you,1
8586,could not get the program to load on my computer,0
8588,Great product,1
8589,Easiest Genealogical program,1
8590,I have used it since it came out,0
8591,They were used as gifts so we could all be on the same software,0
8592,They were well received,1
8593,Met all my expectations and read my current GEDCOM'S just fine!!!!!,1
8594,"As of Jun 2015, RootsMagic 6 no longer interfaces with FamilySearch",0
8596,"By avoiding a minor software update to correct the problem, RootsMagic makes version 6 a major disappointment",0
8597,"In today's digital age, an inability to interface with online databases means you'll be typing sources and data by hand for hours",0
8598,What was a decent piece of software is now practically useless,0
8599,This is not what I was originally promised when I bought version 6 two years ago,0
8600,I feel betrayed,-1
8601,Buyer beware,-1
8602,"Everyone at my geonology class loved this but I wasn't able to use on my computer, gave it to one of the ladies at my class",0
8603,she likes it,1
8604,Great price!,1
8605,Roots Magic is the best home genealogy software available today,1
8606,Go to there web site and browse for the abundant help and how-to information and videos,0
8607,"This is a great program!  It was created by the same author as Family Origins which I used for years, then it became unavailable",1

Happy tree-building!",0
8612,This item gave a close friend the ability to begin working on their genealogy,0
8613,I bought it for a gift,0
8614,Roots Magic 6,0
8615,good product at a good price,1
8616,Very dependably a classic Roots Magic product!,1
8617,It served its purpose,1
8618,It imported raw data from another program,0
8619,"As a long time user of Roots Magic, this was an easy choice as a gift",0
8620,This was just what I needed to continue researching my family tree,0
8621,I mainly use this tool to perform searches and generate reports from other sources (ie,0
8623,com),0
8624,"The reports (family trees) consistently place children in the wrong chronological order, and spouses out of order (wife 2 before wife1)",0
8625,"The individual's birth dates are shown correctly, but the tool apparently doesn't use the date to sort the information",0
8626,The reports are really quite useless as a result,1
8627,Sad considering date sorting is one of the most basic of software functions,0
8628,How that slipped past testing is really beyond me (the dates being compared are a consistent format),0
8629,"From the blogs I've read they refuse to provide a software update fix, instead you must purchase the next version",0
8630,Haven't read if the new version actually fixed the bug,0
8631,"It does have some nice features, such of showing missing data or signalling possible errors within an individual's data",0
8632,Anyone using Ancestry,0
8633,"com knows there are no good search tools there, so you must use a tool such as RootsMagic to perform searches: for instance if you want to find all people in your tree born in a particular town or who are buried in a particular location",0
8634,"This tool can be used for that, and with some reading and practice you can create a nice report of such searches",0
8635,It's a great program,1
8636,"Full featured, FAST, and very easy to work with",1
8637,I've been using it since RM4 and I still love it,0
8638,"My database has over 50,000 entries and the program has never failed me - not one time",0
8639,"I am a big fan of Roots Magic, have been using all versions since their first (and its predecessor as well, Family Origins)",0
8640,"I've tried other programs, and I agree, this one is the winner, hands down",0
8641,"Version 6 in this offer is a bargain, and you could stick with it for a long time and feel good about it",0
8642,"( I keep upgrading, in part to support their good work",0
8643,")  Beginners can't go wrong here, for sure ;-)",0
8644,Not as user friendly or as good as Family Origins,-1
8645,I sent the program to someone,0
8646,"and I don't know what they think of the program, so I can't rate it",0
8647,Used ver 6 till ver 7 was available,0
8648,Ver 6 was purchased as a gift to my children that might be interested in their beginingings,0
8649,"It is the easiest to use, full-featured genealogy software",1
8650,It synchronizes well with FamilySearch,1
8651,The information is presented in an easy-to-understand display,0
8652,It has all the usual reports that are easily accessed,1
8653,"I have used Personal Ancestral File, Legacy 8",0
8654,"0, FamilyTreeMaker and Ancestral Quest, and I like RootsMagic best",0
8655,"Oddly, I am unable to synchronize Legacy 8",-1
8656,0 to FamilySearch,0
8657,"When I got their tech support, I was told that a lot of users had that problem, and some even had to erase and resinstall Windows to get it to work",0
8658,Way too much work and risk to make Legacy worth it,-1
8659,Great geneology software,0
8660,Easy to use,0
8661,Great program with good support if needed,0
8662,Non better!,0
8663,Not as good as Family Tree,0
8664,This program is indeed working for me,1
8665,It's comprehensive and is loaded with information,1
8666,"Whatever your profession is, if you deal with computers, these are invaluable skills to have at your disposal",0
8667,This is a fine product,1
8668,Very good and instructional,1
8669,Easy to follow and understand,1
8670,Great price too,1
8671,Very poorly made,-1
8672,"Besides tellling people the programs layout, it hardly teaches anything about how to use those programs",0
8673,I learn more from watching some of the YouTube clip than watching this,0
8674,The lesson will suddenly stop before completing a whole sentence,0
8675,One star is for the refund policy,0
8676,Hopefully I'll get my $16 back,0
8677,Don't waste your time & money,-1
8678,You'll be extremely disappointed as me,-1
8679,There's simply No Instruction at all,-1
8680,Update as of 2/12/14: Got my refund back,0
8681,The company changed me $9,0
8682,"82 for restocking fee, plus $3",0
8683,99 for S & H,0
8684,My total refund is $6,0
8685,92 from this useless purchase,0
8686,"Need I say more?

Thanks Amazon for posting my review, so hopefully there won't be more victims like me",1
8687,Each lesson is short and clear,0
8688,I've only listened to 5-7 and I've learned useful information in each one,0
8689,I hope to spend more time,0
8690,This is a great item,1
8691,I wondered what I was really going to get for the price listed,0
8692,I ave to admit my expectations were low ad I figured I was going to be duped,0
8693,Surprise -it's a good deal,0
8694,I recommend,1

8710,Excellent for beginners and average users,1
8711,If you're looking for something more challenging this isn't your product,0
8712,I am very pleased with this software,1
8713,The information was presented in a very clear and systematic manner,0
8714,"Just what a ""newby"" to the new Office suite needs!  Very quick delivery too!!",0
8715,This is a powerhouse training video,0
8716,Jam packed with everything you need to learn all the basics on MS Office,0

I wish I was lying to you",0

8736,"This is only beneficial for those that really want to learn, and are dedicated to sitting down and fully immersing themselves in it",0
8737,Thanks for making this!,1
8738,This was a text book,0

8753,I have been using this for a few days,0
8754,It has some nice features over Visio but with simplicity of use comes some loss of flexibility,1
8755,What really struck me is all of the 5 star reviews (every one of them) where none of the reviewers show an actual amazon purchase of this product,0
8756,Dig deeper and you find that 99% of those reviewers have only reviewed this product or maybe one other item,0
8757,Smells like shill reviews to me,0
8758,I started using SmartDraw less than a month ago,0
8759,I have been an avid Visio developer for the past 10 years,0
8760,I tried SmartDraw because the version of Visio was making me work to hard to get the professional looking results I want for my presentations,0
8761,I used my first SmartDraw PowerPoint a few weeks ago and both my client and my boss were amazed at the quality and clarity of the presentation,0
8762,"In fact, I am still getting requests for information on how I created the Slides",0
8763,I am extremely happy with SmartDraw & am a 100% convert,1
8764,"At work, I just got Visio 2010 on my work computer",0
8765,I have been working with it for a few days and it is still not up to the caliber of SmartDraw,0
8766,"Great software SmartDraw,

WHS
Arlington, VA",1
8767,I'm a business standardizing processes from the sales process to employee evaluations,0
8768,The flow charts portion of SmartDraw is phenomenal! The mind mapping tools are great,0
8769,"There are so many tools that smartdraw offers in one product: Forms, Org Charts, Gantt Charts",0
8770,The template library is an excellent resource as well for those projects that you don't want to start from scratch,1
8771,Tech support has been great,1
8772,I couldn't be more satisfied,1
8773,It's fantastic!!,1
8774,I just downloaded the new version,0
8775,I had to create a legal entity organization chart for my company from scratch,0
8776,"We have about 60 corporations, partnerships and disregarded entities",0
8777,"I was able to whip the chart out in about an hour and one-half, color code it, then seamlessly drop pieces of it into PowerPoint",0
8778,The enhanced PowerPoint tools make it even easier than before,0
8779,SmartDraw VP really is different than anything else out there,0
8780,"It automatically formats your visuals, and knows how to do them correctly so they look good even if you have never made one before",0
8781,They call it a visual processor because it is different than traditional graphics software like MS Visio,0
8782,I would recommend it to anyone,1
8783,I started using SmartDraw with version 6,0
8784,"Primarily for space planning, visual presentations of building diagrams, etc",0
8785,"I continue using more and more features all the time - it is an invaluable tool for business planning, org charts, and my current favorite - mind maps",0
8786,I'm so glad I dumped Vizio and moved light years ahead,1
8787,"This program is actually easier to use with Word, Excel and Powerpoint",1
8788,Best $200 I've spent in a long time,0
8789,"I've been using SmartDraw for over 12 years, and without a doubt this new edition is the easiest-to-use yet most powerful software program I've ever used",0
8790,"The visual processor analogy (SmartDraw, the world's first visual processor, is to visuals what a word processor is to text) really makes sense once you use this software",0
8791,It really helps to do what we all want to do - communicate with visuals in our everyday life,1
8792,"You can make process charts (flow charts) to better manage processes, Gantt charts to manage projects, mind maps to brainstorm and organize thoughts, to-do lists, almost anything",0
8793,It has great starter templates and thousands of examples,1
8794,"Whenever I'm not sure what kind of visual to use, or how to communicate something, I browse the many categories and almost always find something that perfectly fits what I'm trying to accomplish",0
8795,"SmartDraw is super intuitive, and so automated it's simply amazing",0
8796,I have been a user of SmartDraw since the VP edition and have watched it evolve up (including the 2012 edition)through the current CI edition,0
8797,This is one of the most amazing software products that I have ever used--hands down,1
8798,"I have been a longtime user of both PowerPoint and Visio, but was looking for something more",0
8799,"Visio is a great program, but cumbersome at times to use",2
8800,I was absolutely mesmerized when I came upon the SmartDraw website and watched the product video which makes a valid case about the powerful impact of visuals in presentations,0
8801,I felt like a kid in a candy store,0
8802,"The possibilities are endless!

The program in itself is extremely easy to use, allowing one to focus more on the creativity aspect instead of the mechanics",1
8803,The layout has the ribbon familiarity of Microsoft programs while still maintaining its own originality,0
8804,These software designers are ahead of their time,0
8805,"The automatic formatting and design templates are unparalleled with anything that I've ever used, and there is no more versatile program out there on the market",0
8806,The compatibility of Smart Draw with other familiar programs (e,0
8807,"Excel, Word, PDF, etc",0
8808,) is a huge plus,1
8809,"I use this program daily in my work, and it consistently puts my finished product above what others in our company can bring to the table",0
8810,"It is my best-kept ""secret",0
8811,"""  One of the most ingenious features they ever came up with is the VPM (Visual Process Management)",0
8812,It is what every manager has only dreamed of--a clever way to document every employee's job process so that information is readily available,0
8813,I use SmartDraw as much for personal use as I do for business; and my children even use it for school projects on a regular basis,0
8814,I have to pay a huge compliment here,0
8815,"Most websites don't impress me, but this one does by leaps and bounds",0
8816,The customer support is outstanding,1
8817,This is one of the most resourceful sites that I have ever visited!  One actually develops a whole new vocabulary and insight on the perspective of business presentations from the wealth of information that is available,0
8818,Each concept is explained thoroughly both in the process as well as business strategy,0
8819,"I can easily spend an hour every time I access their site, looking through the treasure-trove of examples, suggestions and ideas within the Product, Solutions, Training and Articles tabs",0
8820,Perhaps one of the best values of this program is what it gives to the user in a non-physical benefit,1
8821,"Exposure to this program immediately taps into and unlocks one's imagination and gets the creative juices flowing, bringing out the best in your abilities",0
8822,I encourage everyone to make the worthwhile investment for this fantastic program,0
8823,"I have been trying to find a floor plan program that I could, one, operate with ease, to get ideas for a remodel for my home",0
8824,"After trying out 3 others, this is the best one",0
8825,Easy to learn and does a great job! Thank you for making this program available to buy! Beth Pearce,1
8826,This software is simple to use and has lots of on line assistance if you need it,1
8827,The drag and drop elements make diagrams and work flows easy and I can transfer them to Office and PDF documents alike,1
8828,Good for both presentations and hand outs,1
8829,I can recommend this software to anyone even beginners like me,1
8830,"We moved to the new SmartDraw CI, and are still learning the details of this version",1
8831,But this program offers a lot of value for those who want to illustrate a variety of concepts with graphics,1
8832,"We use the Organization Charts regularly, along with flowcharts and infographics",0
8833,The ability to add your own photographs is great,0
8834,The export function to Microsoft and PDF programs is extremely fast and very useful,1
8835,"There are a few quirks, and the program obviously thinks that all organizations are traditionally composed, but overall it is versatile, very useful, and a good value for the price",0
8836,"Our company stopped using ACAD, and, I'm not a SW user, so, when trying to do a plant layout dwg for our Canada plant in DraftSight, I just about gave up",0
8837,I ordered SmartDraw and had it done in a couple of hours (for 15K sq ft facility),0
8838,"Racking, equipment, workstations, forklift storage, packaging storage",0
8839,it was SO easy,1
8840,Which is great for an older person like me who isn't as tech savvy or able to catch onto Solidworks like younger folks trained in 3D software,0
8841,I really appreciated the customer support for Smart Draw,1
8842,They were very helpful in assisting with a minor upgrade and went above and beyond what I was expecting,1
8843,I use the software for compiling Work Place Health and Safety building diagrams and the interface is very easy to use,1
8844,"I have been using your product SmartDraw since 2008, it is an excellent product, very easy to use , excellent value for the price,  As a small business with only a few employees, we only use it 5 or 6 times and year and find it very easy to use",1
8845,"It looks very professional, far better than the excel spread sheet ones I always use to make before buying your product",1
8846,Keep up the good work,1
8847,"I purchased 2012 version of SmartDraw, and upgraded to 2014 when the first one expired",0
8848,I cannot read the program font or icons to use the program - I can only see lines where there should be text and spots where there should be an icon,-1
8849,"The font size appears to be size #6 or #7 - unreadable!  The program tool bar is grey, making it even more difficult to see and read",-1
8850,"When I contacted the company to ask if they could make the font larger and change the grey background to a different color with more contrast, I was told they ""could not""",0
8851,I told them the only reason not to increase the font size would be nothing other than pure arrogance,0
8852,There is no good reason to set the program's font so small or to use a grey background!  The formatting of this program is unprofessional,0
8853,"Additionally, when a map or any other figure is created in SmartDraw and exported to PowerPoint, no editing can be done in PowerPoint",0
8854,"It is necessary to go back into SmartDraw to edit anything exported from the program - this is not functional!

I will not purchase this product again",1
8855,In my day-job I work as a business analyst in the IT department of a life insurance company,0
8856,and have done so for the last two decades,0
8857,Drawing all kinds of diagrams is part of my daily task,0
8858,"Now, we use Visio at work, and therefore I have been doing all of my drawings with Visio (for probably the last 8 - 10 years)",0
8859,"Recently, however, I had to do some additional work at home in order to get a project's documentation prepared in time",0
8860,And because I have been using Visio for a long time (and therefore I know it very well) I decided to buy myself a copy [NOTE: I don't believe in pirated software],0
8861,"However, when I saw the price for Visio, I was shocked",0
8862,and I realised I would never be able to afford it at that hugely inflated price,0
8863,"I don't have the funds like big corporations do, after all",0
8864,So then I started looking for alternatives,0
8865,and found several that were either free or had a free evaluation copy,0
8866,"I downloaded about 5 or 6 different ones, and installed them all",0
8867,Then I started using them,0
8868,"and one by one I came to the conclusion ""this one is no alternative to Visio",0
8869,"it barely does the minimum""",0
8870,and some of them were so clunky,0
8871,Each of them went quickly down the uninstall path --- except SmartDraw,0
8872,"I found that I could get to work quickly with SmartDraw, even though the user interface is quite different to Visio (which I know very well due to many years' use)",0
8873,Using the evaluation version of SmartDraw I was able to finish my system documentation in spite of me being a novice SmartDraw user,0
8874,"So, naturally, when I needed to have a visual processor to do some charting for my own business, I had no hesitation to purchase SmartDraw",0
8875,"I had already done all the analysis previously, and I knew that SmartDraw could do what I needed it to do",0
8876,"What I didn't realise at the time of making the purchase, is that SmartDraw also has a massive library of tutorials and other training materials on their site, some of which I have already used and found helpful",0
8877,"I am by no means a SmartDraw expert (yet), but from what I have seen so far I consider it to be even more powerful than Visio in certain areas",0
8878,"There are some aspects of SmartDraw that are still a bit strange to me, but that is probably only  because I'm not an expert user yet",0
8879,"For instance, I drew a Timeline graph, and then wanted to move some of the elements",0
8880,"I found that I could move them, but that the connecting lines didn't stay connected, so I had to re-connect the lines",0
8881,"I also wanted to change the shape of an item, and although the help indicated that it is was possible to do it I couldn't do it (but I'm sure this was due to my lack of knowledge rather than a defect in SmartDraw",0
8882,"Given what I know now, would I buy SmartDraw again?

Absolutely! Without hesitation!

In fact, the more I use SmartDraw, the more I feel I have definitely made the right decision to purchase it!",0
8883,I used this software for process flow charts to support a patent application,0
8884,"Comared to MS visio, I created my flow charts in less than half the time",0
8885,I was able to learn this software quickly through video links,1
8886,"I did have to contact customer support for a work around as my process chart had some logic that did not make sense to typical flow charts, but customer support was outstanding to work with and they spent 15 minutes patiently on the phone with me helping me",0
8887,Five stars overall due to outstanding customer service post sale and simple to use software for basic process flow charts,1
8888,I even got follow up emails from people (not computer generated follow ups) to make sure I was happy with the product,0
8889,The two areas I needed when I was handed a project in an area I had little experience,0
8890,Documentation of a server room,1
8891,"Racks, hardware,  power",0
8892,I was overwhelmed for the time line,1
8893,The software templates where great for this product,0
8894,On line classes in many areas of work,1
8895,"Easy-to-use with a bunch of pre made projects that start your project with out a
Learning curve",1
8896,Thinsea must have,0
8897,"I had no problem using this program, it is not rocket science",0
8898,"However, every once in a while a pop up would appear in my computer screen promoting one or more of the company's services",1
8899,"There is NO way to stop this intrusion, and the ads keep coming",-1
8900,"So, if you thought you could work in peace by paying this product, you are wrong because they will keep intruding in your work no matter what",0
8901,"Even when you uninstall the product you paid for because it is simply nagging the heck out of your day, they make you fill out a questionnaire and then to make things worse, once your done, they present you with yet another ad for another product (serv) from which you cannot exit without turning your browser completely off (so you lose any of the other pages you had open)",0
8902,Absolutely insane,-1
8903,Stay away from this company,-1
8904,This software has made all my daily tasks 100 times easier,1
8905,I was up and running within minutes of downloading this software,0
8906,The user interface is so intuitive and so well thought out you will take to it straight away,1
8907,"You won't find yourself scrolling through lots of menus to get things done, unlike other programs I have tried",0
8908,"If your like me and like to learn things by video rather than reading large help files, smart draw offers lots of on demand videos to learn what sections of the program you wish to use",0
8909,"The program is so user friendly you may not even need to learn it, you just kind of take to it intuitively",1
8910,I have had the program for a few days now and already have tons of complex flow charts completed,0
8911,"There really isn't much of a learning curve but if you find you need help, smart draw has you covered",0
8912,"I can get so much work done with this program because I am not constantly worrying about laying out boxes and stuff, the program formats everything nicely for you",0
8913,"One of the most important things for me when choosing a visual diagramming software was the ability to be able to just pick it up and go without needing to learn the software, that's exactly what happened with smart draw",0
8914,I opened up a document and just got going easy as 1 2 3,0
8915,"Another great thing was all the different example files that come with smart draw, there is tons",1
8916,If your not familiar with visual diagramming these examples can really help you get a grasp,0
8917,I have had this product only for a few days and already i couldn't imagine life without it,0
8918,It has become an invaluable tool in my workflow increasing my productivity,0
8919,The support staff go above and beyond to serve your needs,0
8920,I could go on and on about this program and I haven't even scratched the surface yet,0
8921,I have not got a bad thing to say about this software period,0
8922,buy it you won't be disappointed pinky promise,0
8923,I'm giving this software a one star because I can't give it zero stars,-1
8924,After downloading this software to my computer I had planned to use it for drafting and 3d printing,0
8925,"After the ""free period"" was up, I didn't have the over $200 to purchase the licensed",0
8926,Here comes the problem,0
8927,THIS SOFTWARE IS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE! It is still on my computer with an annoying POP-UP that I also have not figured out how to remove,0
8928,"If you have windows 7, and you go to ""Programs and Features"" where the program is supposed to be located (So you can uninstall it), you won't find it! Instead you can find lengthy instructions on how to remove it",0
8929,"and to this day, a month after I downloaded it, I can't use, I can't uninstall it, yet I still have an annoying POP-UP everytime I start my computer",0
8930,Show SmartDraw this is not a good idea by not using this product,0
8931,SmartDraw streamlined my project shop drawings submittal process,0
8932,Great user interface and great customer service department if you ever need help,1
8933,"I was used to using Visio at work and decided to get a copy of my own, then Smart Draw popped up on my computer screen and I reviewed the website and Guided Tour video",0
8934,I had a concern that no one would be able to edit what I had produced if they needed to - but it wasn't a big deal for me - so I did a trial that quickly turned into a purchase,-1
8935,"That being said, this program makes me laugh every day because of how easy it is to use (unlike Visio) and how I can flip things into a powerpoint presentation in one click - including all timings, etc",0
8936,I am still learning the many options available to me - and can say mind mapping really did blow my mind,0
8937,I saw patterns in what was happening in a process flow that did not occur to me before,0
8938,Wow and wow,1
8939,"Since this is a new purchase for me, I cannot speak to licensing issues",0
8940,"I am hoping it won't be a big problem to upload new versions, have the program speak to old versions and expand",0
8941,If you are an engineer and you think Visio is the only way to go - please check out this program before you plunk down your cash,0
8942,You won't be disappointed,0
8943,"I am very happy with Smart Draw, it is very easy to use and very versatile",1
8944,I needed a program to draw blueprints and building layouts that is easy to learn and I couldn't be happier,0
8945,"You can make any kind of diagram you want, buildings, electrical, plumbing, electronics, mechanical and more",0
8946,It is great for documents too,1
8947,"This software will save you lots of time, then it will take all that time away as you try and do something which should be a no-brainer; such as justifying text to above instead of below a symbol",0
8948,If you are a detail oriented person it will drive you nuts,0
8949,You will have to learn a lot of work-arounds,0
8950,"I started with the ""Trial Version""",0
8951,My main use is creating simple construction layouts with dimensions,0
8952,"While going through it, I had tons of questions",0
8953,Each question was responded to by a SmartDraw tech within 6 to 36 hours,0
8954,"even on weekends! This to me, is true customer service excellence! Now maybe this software doesn't have ALL the bells and whistles of the more expensive programs, and I have a few minor ""glitches"" to work out, but for the money",0
8955,you can't beat it,0
8956,"But again, as a customer service fanatic",1
8957,I'm completely SOLD! Thanx Smartdraw,1
8958,Other companies could learn from you,0
8959,I've had the program for about a year now and I used it for placing multiple locations on a map,0
8960,Now it doesn't work,-1
8961,There are a lot of bugs in the program and it freezes and shuts down,0
8962,"I suppose it is because they've released a new version, and of course the company wants you to pay for an upgrade (they send numerous marketing emails informing you of the upgrade",0
8963,")  So, this version ""conveniently"" stopped working on my computer right as the new version was released",0
8964,Downloaded the free trial and was instantly blown away by the org chart capabilities,0
8965,"Was easy to use, easy to edit and easy to export",1
8966,A+,1
8967,I recently purchased SmartDraw 2013 to help me create a conceptual model to represent a riparian ecosystem I am working on restoring,0
8968,I had been using PowerPoint but had gotten extremely frustrated with its lack of versatility,0
8969,When I looked into my options I first tried some open source products that were free,0
8970,"On the surface they appeared to be very applicable, but as I used them I quickly ran into bugs and realized that I needed something tried and true that had people that stood behind it so I could call when or if I had an issue",0
8971,So I downloaded the free trial of SmartDraw,0
8972,I tried it out for about a half an hour and liked it so much I bought it,0
8973,This was exactly the product I had been looking for,1
8974,Immediately I found the interface intuitive to use,0
8975,It felt like a weight had been lifted from my back,0
8976,Because SmartDraw is so intuitive I feel like I can focus on the project rather than the software,0
8977,It has definitely increased my productivity and creativity and provided a clear benefit to this project,0
8978,I hope you find it as useful as I have,0
8979,"I work for a retail company that specializes in building products and home repair, think locally owned Home Depot",0
8980,We decided to try using Smart Draw to recreate our store floor plan from a previous image,0
8981,"After our free trial ended, we purchased  the basic package to continue the project",0
8982,"I ran into some pit falls and frustrations at the beginning, not getting lines to go exactly where I wanted them to in a floor layout, etc",0
8983,But one phone call to technical support had the issue fixed in under a minute! My business is very excited about the great potential that we see with Smart Draw and all of the different applications that it can be used for,0
8984,"This is a great product, especially for the price",1
8985,I would definitely recommend this product to other businesses looking to do anything from floor plans and planograms to flow charts!,1
8986,I used Vizio for years while working as a landscape designer,0
8987,I recently saw a colleague use Smartdraw and I knew I needed it immediately,0
8988,"There are more templates, easier to use, and way more bang for the buck",0
8989,Thanks Smartdraw,1
8990,Penny Poarch,0
8991,I just bought this program and made a brochure and business card that pretty much saved my company,1
8992,Thank you very much!!,1
8993,I was working late and needed to build a workflow presentation for a morning meeting,0
8994,"I ordered the basic version, it loaded simply and got right to work",0
8995,When I needed to save to a,0
8996,pdf I had to download the plug in,0
8997,which self installed and I didn't even need to close the program to do so,0
8998,"Simply put, it worked like you would expect it to!! (which is rarely the case in software anymore!)",0
8999,I downloaded Smart Draw on a 7 day trial and had some issues with it,0
9000,They were instantly resolved when I contacted customer service at Smart Draw,0
9001,"For the price, it is an excellent program and have not seen another one that compares on the market",1
9002,"I'm a (German) business consultant and have all kinds projects, org-, flow-, and gantt-charts, etc",0
9003,on my desk most of which I can't delegate to someone else,0
9004,Among others I have French and Belgian business partners and clients,0
9005,"While it is important to visualize things when working with people having the same native tongue, with people who don't visualization becomes a question of life or death of your projects (as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - ten thousand, if they are in broken English, sorry I can't offer you any pictures here)",0
9006,After ten years of trudging through MS Visio I reluctantly tested SmartDraw2014,0
9007,I bought it after half an hour of testing,0
9008,I could do things intuitively and faster and with better results than after ten years with visio,0
9009,As clients pay me for results and not for the time it takes me to produce and visualize them the ROI is simply fantastic,0
9010,"The same can be said for the service which is fast, competent and very friendly",0
9011,"The online-training is to the point and entertaining (well, they certainly are at an advantage here, using their own program)",0
9012,I've been using SmartDraw every day for four weeks now (on a Windows 7 platform) and have had no bigger problems than vading through the vast collection of templates they offer from the rack,0
9013,I discovered SmartDraw by chance when researching for an easy way to draw flowcharts to create global workflow for my company,0
9014,My collegaues were so impressed how quickly and easy to use SmartDraw to create professional work flow,1
9015,It has all the required pre-set templates and countless of examples for those who are not familiar with flow charts,0
9016,I highly recommend SmartDraw for those seeking to use flow chart to standardize work flow & processes,1
9017,Thank you SmartDraw for a wonderful product,1
9018,"No regrets only praises!

9019,"I work as a training developer, spending most of my week focussing upon creating engaging training material",0
9020,"I have found that SmartDraw is both a pleasure to use and also allows me to create high quality graphics that look good both in presentations, like PowerPoint, and also in printed documents",0
9021,"Using SmartDraw, rather than the previous product I used, means that my focus is back on creation of high quality content instead of on the tools",0
9022,SmartDraw is simply better and faster than anything I have used before,1
9023,I have used VISIO in the past but Smartdraw blows it away,0
9024,The ease in which templates can be viewed and downloaded makes all types of planning breeze,1
9025,The user bars are friendly and saving your work is an easy click of the mouse,1
9026,"Planning my projects and flow charts have never been easier!

9027,I think this is really a great product,1
9028,Truly easy to use and NOT to mention you have access via online,1
9029,It really helps me think out a project prior to diving in to get a lot of questions answered that maybe you have not thought about,1
9030,Looking forward to diving into this program much more over the next year,0
9031,I was looking for software to help me lay out a dance studio for my girlfriend's new business,0
9032,I tried one other brand and it was cool but a bit difficult for me to catch on to,0
9033,The next day I found Smartdraw and everything seemed so much easier to learn to use,0
9034,And the library of things to use is really helpful,1
9035,Before I knew it I had spent three hours on my project and couldn't believe the time went by so fast,0
9036,I recommend it to anyone that like to do design work,1
9037,I am a Professional Software Trainer and Instructional Designer,0
9038,I absolutely love SmartDraw,1
9039,It is a new application for me and the features and functionality are very intuitive,1
9040,When comparing SmartDraw to Viso I found SmartDraw easier to use,1
9041,"I typically work with very short timelines and have to complete projects quickly, therefore I love the Templates! You really have to experience this application",0
9042,"I have been able to do a Gant Chart, An organizational Chart, Mind Mapping, and a Timeline",0
9043,"I know this is just the ""tip of the iceberg"", but I am so excited to have an application where it does not require a lot of my time to learn the application",0
9044,I can produce a finished deliverable within a matter of minutes! This Software makes me look good! It is on Fire!,1
9045,This is an outstanding product!  It is much more intuitive to use than similar products such as Visio,1
9046,"It has a great interface, and extensive collection of forms and templates to choose from, and you can literally build fantastic presentations in no time",1
9047,I love it and would recommend this to other professionals in the IT industry or other,1
9048,I started using Smartdraw shortly after the now defunct Micrografx discontinued Windows Draw! I am also a veteran chemical engineer well versed in the use of CAD packages,0
9049,Smartdraw beautifully bridges the vast void that exists between expensive CAD packages typically used to produce abstract vector-based process drawings and the high-end raster graphics packages more typical of illustrations and graphics,0
9050,"If you don't have the money to spend on CAD, nor the desire to learn what amounts to be very steep learning curve packages like Photoshop, but still need a way to communicate your data, ideas and concepts in a manner that will wow your audience (in spite of limited artistic skills), then give this software a shot",0
9051,The developers have continued to make subtle but substantial improvements with the package,0
9052,Some highlights include the extensive symbol and graphics libraries that make assembly of rich illustrations trivial,0
9053,The templates that come with this package are phenomenal as well,0
9054,You can spend a couple hours just looking at all the examples and getting ideas from them,0
9055,The smart graphs are a killer way to take the admittedly powerful tools in Excel up a notch,0
9056,"Even though Smartdraw provides powerful and extensive exporting functionality, it is a simple one-click affair to get your work into Microsft office and it goes out of its way to make the integration (back and forth for those last minute edits) seemless",0
9057,"For those who dare to do more, the granularity of the editing tools is all there, with and endless array of gradients, line, pattern, etc",0
9058,"that can be used to create custom, polished graphics",0
9059,You can even set up your own templates along with common blocks and setting like I do and use them for common work,0
9060,"Recently, they've jumped on the cloud wagon and provide an iOS app that makes work accessible and easier to manage",0
9061,This has saved me already from an accidental file deletion,0
9062,"As a process engineer, my work can be abstract and well, boring to many folks",0
9063,"Smartdraw changes that, making my drawings come to life and intuitive to casual observers given the nature of the graphics vs",0
9064,simple CAD symbols,0
9065,"It's so simple to combine photos and vector graphics into one and kick off a pdf that anyone can view that you will be hearing ""how did you do that"" a lot",1
9066,The package does take some time getting used to,0
9067,"While the ribbon interface is done well, some settings and features can be a bit quirky",0
9068,I still have trouble with snaps versus grid specs,0
9069,"And a couple pet peeves remain like if you rotate a symbol, it will cause connected lie arrows to rotate as well",0
9070,There are work-abounds but it's still annoying,-1
9071,"In my work, Office, AutoCAD and Smartdraw are the keys to my productivity",0
9072,I'd say that puts Smartdraw in some good company and places a whole lot of power into folks like me with limited budget and artistic skills to boot,0
9073,"Try the trial, you have nothing to lose",0
9074,"As someone who has run $6oo+ million businesses, and helped countless start-ups through the formation stages to success, I can earnestly recommend Smartdraw as a third most important asset behind you and your people",0
9075,"The great challenge we all face individually and in corporate community is the trifecta of clarity/agreement on purpose, engagement/development of plan and active ownership/modification of execution",1
9076,The Smartdraw solutions suite offers the tools anyone needs to create and execute against multiple corporate challenges,0
9077,"Whether the challenge is the repair of a ""big and broken"" corporate process, or the re-creation of an ailing brand, Smartdraw has it all",0
9078,The great part about the solutions set is that is frees you up to work on the solution by significantly reducing the time required in creating the output/tracking doc's needed to deliver projects,1
9079,"There are many additional ""solutions"" that I suspect will be added along the way",0
9080,but what they have is a great start,1
9081,I chose to purchase SmartDraw after a 30-day trial period because it made creating flow charts and organization charts very easy,1
9082,"I am not gifted in terms of technology, so easy is important to me",1
9083,I've already flowed out 3 processes and I only started with my applications a few days ago,0
9084,Smart draw is an excellent choise when one needs an affordable and still good quality tool for doing engineering drawings,1
9085,"I have used different versions of smartdraw since 2003 and also other similar tools, but I always come back",0
9086,"I have been in the oil and gas business for over thirty years, and I have never found a more useful tool than ""Smart Draw"" which I use for flowcharts, but has loads of different applications",0
9087,"Because of ""Smart Draw"" I have been able to offer to my clients totally professional flowcharts for easy reference for mineral title",0
9088,"You could never go wrong with any of the ""Smart Draw"" products as they are all top-notch professional, and quite easy to use",0
9089,"If you are looking for a tool that will set you apart from all the others professionally, look no further because ""Smart Draw"" is the tool you need",0
9090,"I love it, and will never use anything different",1
9091,I am a building contractor and purchased smart draw after taking advantage of the free download to experience the system firsthand,0
9092,I was not about to invest in something without being given the opportunity to test drive it,0
9093,Smartdraw gave me the opportunity to use it and it paid off,1
9094,"At first I was very clumsy, but before long I had learned to create sketches and drawings with very clear and concise information for my clients and contractors",1
9095,Smartdraw has made me much more efficient and professional when presenting work to my customers,0
9096,"Lastly, the support has been excellent",1
9097,"The person on the other line is informative, friendly, and appears to actually care what I am trying to achieve",0
9098,"Oh, and they speak perfect English and reside in the United States",0
9099,What really sold me on this product was the fact that I had a technical question that I posted on a Sunday and I got a reply within a few hours,0
9100,How many companies do that these days? I'm in the sw business myself and I know the financial pressure on cutting back on support staff,0
9101,"Thank goodness someone resisted the urge on this product!

I've been using the product to produce some basic mechanical drawings where I needed dimensions and an electrical diagram for documenting some wiring changes that I made",1
9102,It took almost no time to learn how to do this - even using the basic features,0
9103,"I like how every time I said, ""I wonder if I can change that behavior"", the answer was generally, ""yes, I can""",0
9104,The product seems very robust and I never experienced any crashes or problems,1
9105,"It completely addressed what I was trying to do, and I guess that is what you want a product to do for you",1
9106,The trial demo let me test all the features I needed and only then did I commit to the purchase,0
9107,"Happy I did!
ken",1
9108,Immediately after downloading this software it was easy to use,1
9109,The charts I created were effective in the meeting I needed to attend the next day,0
9110,"I used Visio for years (several years ago) but migrated to web-based diagramming solutions like Gliffy, Diagramly, Flowchart, Bubbl, and Mindomo for all of my diagramming needs",0
9111,"When I found myself missing Visio, I decided to see what alternatives I could find before making the $500+ investment",0
9112,"(I'd need at least the Professional, if not the Premium version",0
9113,")

In search of a Visio alternative I found SmartDraw",0
9114,I took the 7-day trial but didn't need the 7 days,0
9115,"I purchased it (digital download only), for a reasonable $197, the moment I finished my first project",0
9116,I can honestly say that SmartDraw is worth every penny if you spend any time at all working on flow charts or diagrams,0
9117,"Plus, they also have mind maps, decision trees, Google map integration, genograms, all kinds of visuals - I'm sure I haven't even discovered all of the features there actually are",0
9118,It's super easy to use,1
9119,If you need to open,0
9120,"vsd files (visio), you'll need enterprise",0
9121,As Investment bankers we do many presentations and we wanted to source a product that would help us prepare visuals and cut down on the time it takes to cut a deck of slides,0
9122,SmartDraw 2013 is an easy to use product,1
9123,It is intuitive and we were able to use the product easily from the online tutorials,1
9124,The template bank makes life very easy,1
9125,We like the ability to either use a template to get started and then to personalise the output,1
9126,We found the product more versatile than Visio and at a fraction of the cost,0
9127,It integrates effortlessly into the MS office suite of products,1
9128,It is simple to use,1
9129,The customer service is great,1
9130,We are in Australia and they seamlessly assisted us to optimise the package and use the features,1
9131,We need some assistance and we received a response within hours,1
9132,I bought this because I needed to produce a number of flow charts,1
9133,I was able to get that done really quickly,1
9134,I liked that I didn't have to drag around a lot of boxes and align things,1
9135,you pretty much just click the buttons and the boxes go where they're supposed to,1
9136,I also liked the mind map capabilities,1
9137,It lets you flip back and forth between a mind map and a Gantt chart (like Microsoft Project) view of the same information,0
9138,"It didn't have all the features of Project, but it had the ones that I used most often, without a lot of the clutter",0
9139,The bar/pie/line chart features were straightforward and pretty easy to use,1
9140,It has floorplan capabilities and a ton of other drawing types that I'll probably have a need for,0
9141,Great product!,1
9142,We purchased this package for our company as some of the graphic icons and libraries look nice,1
9143,"However, the software itself is clumsy and unrefined, but nothing you can't get around to",-1
9144,"The deal breaker here is SmartDraw's byzantine licensing practices that sells you a digital product and then remove access to the file after some time!

We legally purchased the digital download version of this product and one year later we upgraded a workstation the download link was not available any longer",0
9145,"After contacting SmartDraw, the representative told us that the only way to download it again would be upgrading to the latest edition, wich we found unacceptable; so we end up having to download a torrent a version of a software we already paid for",0
9146,They also make  extremely complicated to authorize multiple installs,-1
9147,"Instead of having an authorization system like itunes, they force you to login to their website and manually enable / disable every install",0
9148,"With so many layers of security, one would think we were dealing with the best software on earth",1
9149,I just wish Smartdraw would put as much effort on improving their product as they do in adding cumbersome  security features that only serve to annoy existing customers,-1
9150,"It is sad that you can actually download an illegal version of the product that works easier and better because the hackers even took the time to remove the ""phone home""  annoying security features",1
9151,"SmartDraw's, stop treating your paying customers like criminals so we don't have to act like one",-1
9152,The program looked fine and modern at first glance,1
9153,"However, it is not usable for business graphics, because important features missing",1
9154,The data import is abysmal and the labels can not be edited together,0
9155,SmartDraw is unsuitable for professional use!,-1
9156,I Smartdraw 2012 Standard edition to create flow diagrams,0
9157,I find the functionality perfectly satisfactory for what I need to use the software for,0
9158,"But I'm really fed up with all the crashes - in a 2 hour session, it will normally crash up to 5 times",-1
9159,I've got into the habit of saving frequently but it's still very annoying when it happens,0
9160,This product has a unique approach to flow charting and when it works it is fast and fluid and beats Visio hands down,0
9161,The mind mapping works great and is one of the best charts and really shows off what Smart Draw can do,0
9162,However this is the exception not the norm,0
9163,"I bought it for use in creating diagrams for computer system and software engineering, creating a time line and flowchart for a book I'm working on, and for event flow charts in role-playing adventures",0
9164,"The book I'm working on is a fantasy world and uses fantasy dates (1000 - 1200, etc)",0
9165,"Unfortunately the lowest year you can ""customize"" is 1971",0
9166,Quite frequently when you add another event to the timeline only the black handles appear instead of the full event box,0
9167,You have to add another event to clear the artifact and see the actual event,0
9168,If you open the sample Police report by Hour and try and change any of the times on any of events the entire chart will disappear,0
9169,"Or if you switch the Timeline format to Auto from Hourly, it'll create a very vertical time line",0
9170,Switching back to hourly and you will be presented with a timeline and no events,0
9171,One of the most frustrating things about creating a flow chart is once you use auto charting either by using ctrl + arrow key or using the GUI you can't turn off snapping to that symbol,0
9172,Any library symbols you drag near that symbol will attempt to auto snap,0
9173,If you never use the auto charting then you can freely drop items onto the canvas and on top of other symbols,0
9174,For the most part auto snapping is preferred as it is Smart Draw's main feature that differentiates it,0
9175,However I was attempting to create a Post/Postback flowchart; which shows how the information flows from the client to the server and back again in web development,0
9176,I wanted two small flowcharts in parallel to show this process,0
9177,I ended up having to drop each flow chart symbol on the canvas and then after everything was in place take the line tool to draw a connection point in between each item,0
9178,"At this point, I was by passing the main reason I bought the software",0
9179,This isn't very intuitive and is invasive to my workflow,-1
9180,There are other visual bugs such as when you want to resize a symbol and keep the aspect ratio,0
9181,You do this by holding down the shift key and dragging the handles,0
9182,It works fine until a symbol is attached to another symbol by a line,2
9183,"When you attempt to resize in this scenario, the object will begin flashing yellow and very quickly jump from the size you want to the original size",0
9184,This is very distracting and something you would expect to see in beta code but not release quality,-1
9185,It does resize correctly,-1
9186,You can change the way symbols are sized by editing the symbol in the SmartPanel or Library,0
9187,"You can specify Use Fixed Size, Scale to Ruler Settings, or manually change but you can't do it for the entire library",0
9188,There is no way to create a custom symbol list i,-1
9189,symbol palette,0
9190,Instead you have to switch in between the out of the box symbol libraries (which is a solid list),0
9191,Another annoying issue is that the undo does not work on the Ink functionality; it's a completely separate mechanism to the rest of the program,-1
9192,"If you do decide to buy, get the physical media",0
9193,At $197 dollars for the software and $49,0
9194,95 to be able to re-download it for a year it's too much,0
9195,With Visual Studio Standard coming in at less than $200,0
9196,00 it's the better value,0
9197,The product has so much potential I really hope Smart Draw fixes the issues and adds some enhancements to increase workflow with the next version,1
9198,Ultimately they sold me on the idea of the Visual Processor because it's a cool concept,0
9199,However the execution really falls short,-1
9200,I've spent more time fighting with the Visual Processor than being productive and this is why I can't recommend the product,-1
9201,They use to hava a decent program,0
9202,New program is just really sad,0
9203,They put a lot of really useless crap in this program,0
9204,Save your money,0
9205,The license model deceive the customer,0
9206,"You buy a license for ONE USER, but it doesn't show you that ONE USER means ONE COMPUTER",0
9207,You can't install and use this program on two or more computers if you have so,-1
9208,"If you request that, they send you a quote to buy more licenses",0
9209,"Until they change this, you shouldn't buy this software",0
9210,I agree with other reviewers that the customer service and sales tactics are entirely unsatisfactory,0
9211,"Having changed laptops, I was told that I could not disactivate the previous version (2009) and reinstall it on my new laptop because the prevous version was ""no longer supported",0
9212,"""  At the same time I was cheekily told that I should have initially bought the ""Platinum Protection,"" as if $230 was not enough for the software, and that I had ""already received full value for what I purchased",0
9213,"""  So in other words a client who buys the product and then changes laptops without forking out more for ""protection"" or for a backup CD is out of luck",0
9214,In the end I was offered again to buy the CD or to buy the new product at a discount but this still strikes me as entirely unfair,0
9215,"In short, I believe that as consumers we have the choice of how to spend our money and I would not recommend giving your custom to this company",0
9216,I have downloaded SmartDraw and installed it,0
9217,"I bought it mainly for Mind Maps and this is suppose to be very easy on any mind mapping software, but to my surprise it is the most horrible experience I ever had for mind mapping on SmartDraw",0
9218,Basically it did not serve my purpose,0
9219,Now I have decided not to use it with in one hour of my installation,0
9220,"SmartDraw fills a niche, but doesn't do it well for several reasons",0
9221,"First, the program is just plain glitchy, and this latest version is glitchier than earlier versions",0
9222,"Creating an organization chart should be simple, right?  It draws the simplest charts easily, but when you start to add more positions or insert support functions, forget it",0
9223,"The chart moves all over the place, and no matter how hard you try to move a position around, there are always problems",0
9224,"I used to love, love, love the floor plan function",1
9225,"In this latest version, though, you are forced to do many more clicks to do the same functions",0
9226,"My worst complaint, however, is with the company's management decisions",-1
9227,"I have downloaded this program onto my Intel Mac (partitioned with Windows, ugh!) twice now, and the program keeps disappearing",-1
9228,"I contacted the company, and the response was very matter-of-fact like it happens all the time",0
9229,The customer support told me just to download the program again,0
9230,"Sorry, if I pay for the program, I don't think I should have to download it repeatedly just because the company is so paranoid about pirated copies",0
9231,"In my opinion, it is just a matter of time before another company comes along and fills the niche better",0
9232,"I was confused by the reviews here, which seem to be all over the map",0
9233,"In the end, I decided to take a chance and purchase SmartDraw 2012 Standard, which I purchased by phone from the manufacturer",0
9234,"Their website offered only a downloadable version, and I wanted a ""hardcopy"" on CD",0
9235,"The person I spoke with at SmartDraw was very helpful in answering questions, and said they can ship a packaged version for an additional $19",0
9236,"95, which I was fine with",0
9237,"No sooner did I hang up, than I found an email with a link for downloading SmartDraw immediately, which I wasn't expecting, but really appreciated being able to use the software right away, without having to wait for the CD",0
9238,There was also a second email with links to a series of tutorials - I appreciated this too,0
9239,I have started using SmartDraw to create some basic flowcharts and value stream mapping,0
9240,"So far, the software is quite intuitive and fairly easy to use right off the bat",1
9241,"In places where I got stuck, the help system has been informative and easy to use",1
9242,"One thing I'm liking a lot is that while the program takes care of the automatic formatting of flow charts and diagrams, it seems you are not limited to just the symbols and elements within a particular template",0
9243,"There are some basic drawing tools you can use to create ""custom"" elements on your chart",0
9244,The overall design of the program is pleasing,1
9245,"It's simple, clean and functional, and easy to navigate",1
9246,"I wish Microsoft would take a lesson, as the user interface is much simpler than, say, Word or Excel",1
9247,"There are tons of different types of charts to choose from, many more than you will ever use (anatomical diagrams, anyone?)",0
9248,"For each type of chart there is a library of appropriate symbols and elements, as well as many ready made charts that can be used straight away if they fit your needs",0
9249,"The automatic formatting, and the ability to customize the fonts, colors, effects, etc",0
9250,", make it quick and easy to produce charts to your liking",1
9251,These are my initial impressions after doing a few charts,0
9252,If I run into any significant problems I'll update this review,0
9253,"By the way, I did not encounter any of the licensing issues or other complaints that some reviewers have",0
9254,"It's possible that these issues pertained to earlier versions?  So far it's all been straight forward, with nice service and what seems like a good product that will meet my needs",0
9255,Maybe the company took note and improved its policies,0
9256,"The company's website has a complete listing, with examples and tutorials, of all the different types of charts, so you should be able to get a pretty good idea if this product will meet your requirements",0
9257,"For me, it was being able to see everything included in the product that made me decide to go ahead and purchase it",0
9258,UPDATE 3/20/2012,0
9259,"I've had the opportunity to make some more charts, and I'm really liking the software",1
9260,"Once I got accustomed to the method for adding, inserting, and positioning elements, I now find it very easy and fast to create charts on the fly",0
9261,"In fact, it's so easy that I can really use the product as a thinking tool - that is, to work out my ideas in chart form as they develop",1
9262,"The charts are also attractive; you can change fonts, font sizes, fill colors and shading as easily as you would do these things in a word processor",1
9263,The automatic formatting keeps everything looking clean and sharp,1
9264,There seems to be a lot of flexibility and few restrictions,2
9265,It's working great for me so far,1
9266,Just that you all know - this is actually the ENTERPRISE VERSION,0
9267,This sells normally for $497,0
9268,I found out by calling smartdraw directly to inquiry what version this might be,0
9269,They said: great deal!,1
9270,For $49 this application would be worth it but $200 in nonsense,0
9271,"Shallow, not very powerful, no guides in the drawing canvas, no ability to merge shape outlines",-1
9272,a complete disappointment for someone trying to draw scale mechanical drawings,-1
9273,Not Recommended,-1
9274,I am a graphic artist and wanted something that would allow me to create some shmatlzy graphics w/o beginning from scratch,0
9275,I find this product much less user friendly that I would have hoped,-1
9276,They are quick to want to sell thier yearly support for an extra sum even prior to adequately helping me with issues and questions I had creating my very first graphic file,1
9277,"I just bought it, so maybe I will be happier later on, but for right now, on deadline, it would have been better for me to create from scratch using the graphics tools that I already have",1
9278,I am a bit dissapointed,-1
9279,This is the most un intuitive software I have ever seen,-1
9280,You will need to call support for even the simplest procedures,-1
9281,This product allows installation on only one computer,-1
9282,"Its competitor, Microsft Visio, installs on two computers including my laptop without any activation hassles",0
9283,If you want to move the product to a new computer then forget it if it is over a year since you bought it,0
9284,"You for all practical purposes have to upgrade to the latest version(with one year ""protection"") in order to be able to download since they do not allow you to download your old, PAID FOR product and activate it if it is over one year old",0
9285,Folks you can't make this stuff up,0
9286,This is GOT to be the worst in history of software,-1
9287,I have done business with virtually every major software company out there and I cannot name one with such draconian policies,0
9288,"Another in the long line of headaches is that if you purchased an ""upgrade"" you must have the OLD version ON the harddisk",0
9289,You cannot just put in a qualifying serial number,0
9290,Folks this whole thing is a headache,-1
9291,If I could give it -5 stars I would,-1
9292,"I bought the software SmartDraw online on 11/27/  I found the marketing deceptive as the libraries were empty and
the product really an expensive knock off on simpler software",-1
9293,"But it was and remains the lousy customer service that
has caught my attention",0
9294,"Consider this--if you think government workers are ineffective and could care less, try the customer service
folks at SmartDraw and you will find a bigger bunch of morons",0
9295,"I made 3 telephone calss over 2 weeks to get a credit on my charge card,
as I requested a refund the next day",0
9296,"Yes, they will answer the phones",0
9297,But they will basically do nothing,0
9298,"Two weeks later no
credit has been issued and I am disupting the transaction",0
9299,"I truly believe customer service has vanished in America and has re appeared in the
Phillipines or India or wheverever they can't speak decent English or pronounce anything as it should be",0
9300,"DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE OR
ANYTHING FROM SMARTDRAW OR YOU AT AT RISK OF NEVER GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK AND DEALING WITH ANOTHER BUNCH OF VAPID IDIOTS",-1
9301,Smartdraw responded that you can have their system on only one computer,0
9303,"Cannot put on my desktop and laptop, which most companies allow",0
9304,Another problem is what do you do when you get a new computer and happen to forget to tell them beforehand (deactivate or whatever they do),-1
9305,Test drove program and it is good but this pricing thing scares me,0
9306,I was introduced to SmartDraw during my college years as part of a software class focused on object-oriented modeling,0
9307,The program has become so embedded into my professional career that I cannot think of being without it,0
9308,"I have always maintained a license on my personal machine, but have gone so far as to purchase an additional license for a machine at my own expense to ensure that I'm also able to utilize the functionality at work",0
9309,"If you're looking to diagram, chart, map, or make logical sense of ANYTHING, there's a template for it",0
9310,Comparing this program to Visio is doing it a disservice - SmartDraw goes beyond the simple diagramming available in Visio and allows you to actually use the software as part of a problem solving process,0
9311,"SmartDraw has SO many templates available for you to use to kick off your thought process, and you can always modify them or just start from scratch as the mood suits you",0
9312,"For those who would compare it to Visio, SmartDraw beats its Microsoft competitor hands down",0
9313,"First of all, when you connect a line to something in SmartDraw, the program is intelligent enough to maintain that link even when you move things around",0
9314,"Adding text, changing line formats, aligning objects, changing object shapes, and changing color schemes are 1-2 click functions (most of which are available from the right-click menu of a given object)",0
9315,It's an intuitive program with limitless possibilities,-1
9316,This program integrates seemlessly with MS Office applications,0
9317,"As an example, if you have your PowerPoint presentation open and you have created an image or diagram in SmartDraw, there is a button at the top of the screen to ""send to PowerPoint"" which literally creates a new slide *in the file you are already working in* with your image in the center, waiting for you to add a title",0
9318,The customer service package that comes with SmartDraw is also exceptional,1
9319,"Any time I've had a question or suggestion for a product enhancement, I receive a response within hours without detailed instructions on how to perform the functionality I was looking for, or a promise to forward the suggestion to the development team for a future release",0
9320,"And since future releases and updates are always being pushed out with new templates and functionality, I have yet to be disappointed",0
9321,The ONE downside is sharing images to those who don't have the program,0
9322,"However, as this same issue exists for Visio (which does a small fraction of the functionality and doesn't come with a built-in",0
9323,"pdf exporter), SmartDraw has and will remain my diagramming tool of choice",0
9324,Most of the problems posted seem to result from having used the trial or older versions of the software,0
9325,"As I've been using this product for at least 5 years, I will agree that past versions had issues opening files and weren't as versatile",0
9326,"However, these complaints should be posted on the page for SmartDraw 2009; SmartDraw VP resolved these issues by incorporating functionality to push out continuous updates as new functionality emerged and/or issues were identified and resolved",0
9327,"As for the people posting negative reviews after only using the trial version, these appear to be people who want to get the software without paying for it and are upset that the company limited functionality in the trial to prevent that from happening",0
9328,"Unless you're reviewing the ""full package"", there's no way to understand or even be aware of the full potential of the software",0
9329,"If you're willing to pay hundreds (if not thousands) for MS applications, this product is definitely worth the investment",0
9330,I am a Senior Move Manager and Stager and used your floor plan designer for the first time last month,0
9331,It was easy to learn and very user friendly,1
9332,My clients were so excited when seeing their floor plan with all their precious antiques and favorite furniture placed in their new home,0
9333,It made it easy for my clients to know what to leave behind and what to take with them when the movers came to give a moving estimate,0
9334,"Then, of course, the move was seamless",0
9335,We already knew where everything would go,0
9336,The applications were nice because I could input wood grains and colors in order to see how rooms would actually look,0
9337,It was easy for my clients to identify each piece because I could even add fabric design,1
9338,"The move went smoothly, the new home looks beautiful, and my clients are very happy",1
9339,I would highly recommend this program,1
9340,it made my job much easier!,1
9341,"I downloaded the ""free"" VP trial version, based on glowing product descriptions, hoping to find an inexpensive practical solution for a particular kind of work",0
9342,What I found was that the program was priced at $300 for a single-seat license and will not do the kind of drawing it was promoted for,0
9343,"And its general design is quite poor, often awkward and unwieldy",0
9344,"It probably will do some things reasonably well, but I think it is too limited and rigid for general use",0
9345,"Worse, the entire marketing scheme is dishonest",-1
9346,"First off, they claim a five-star review rating on Amazon, ignoring the several one- and two-star ratings",0
9347,And it is grossly overpriced,-1
9348,They offer a $100 discount if you purchase by a short deadline,0
9349,"That ""deadline"" is regularly shoved out just a few days ahead to apparently stampede a purchase",0
9350,"The $100 ""discount"" brings the price down to about the regular price on Amazon, so the whole ""discount"" offer is a sham",0
9351,The obviously shilled five-star reviews here are another example of dishonest self-promotion,0
9352,There is a basic principle in online purchasing (actually applicable to many aspects of life):  Never buy anything from anyone who lies to get your attention,0
9353,"Notwithstanding all that, the program might be useful for some people for a limited kind of work",0
9354,For those narrow purposes even I might be induced to pay $30 or $40 for it,0
9355,Amazon sells previous versions for not much more than that,0
9356,"Some of those might be worth the price for some users, and on that basis I'll give it two stars",0
9357,"I was initially seeking a program that I could use just for drawing floorplans for kitchens, with the ability (if possible) to draw and label carcase designs",0
9358,"During the process, I was given an old (ancient?) computer and I found, amongst its programs, SmartDraw trial version",0
9359,"After browsing thru the program for a couple of days, I was blown away! It was exactly what I was looking for, plus more! I purchased it (at a very good price compared with the likes of AutoCad Lt",1
9360,etc) and haven't looked back,0
9361,"Really user friendly, well laid out, packed with features and really intuitive, with excellent back-up and video training thrown in! I am so impressed that I have recommended it to my son and two of my friends, who are also cabinet makers",1
9362,"And that, to me, is the greatest accolade that can be given to the likes of SmartDraw - after 30 years of running my own company, and thousands of dollars on programs that are just ""not quite right"", to find something so good, and so cost effective, is all in the ""plus"" region",0
9363,Thanks SmartDraw,1
9364,MiColl Enterprises,0
9365,I was first excited about this product,1
9366,Was very close in purchasing but before going ahead decided to look at the reviews,0
9367,I quickly found out that this product is not as great as it is described and the new license agreement I don't like as I would like to easly access my license and software in case I need,1
9368,Too bad as it semed promissing when I used it and was easy to use,2
9369,"After spending the better part of the day trying to figure out the free ""test"" I've given up",0
9370,I tried drawing up a room going at it from different angles and it always comes out like crap,0
9371,"Get one wall the right length and all the other are out of whack, Fix them and now the angles are all askew, fix the angles and the lengths of the walls change",0
9372,I'm just gonna get some graph paper and do it in a fraction the time,0
9373,If a wall is 20 ft,0
9374,at one end and I enter 20 for the other end the angles shouldn't go haywire,0
9375,Ridiculous nonuser friendly program,-1
9376,"This is a very long review but I have endeavored to share what I have learned using SmartDraw since 2007 and the results of trying, but failing, to find a similar product",0
9377,8/8/2012 UPDATE I have updated to the 2012 version of Smart Draw and am very happy with the changes,0
9378,"I have recently worked with floor plans, elevations, gardens, graphs, timelines and gantt charts",0
9379,I was frustrated and finally gave up trying to make a timeline that was by quarter for 18 months,-1
9380,I did a workaround and the result was quite nice,1
9381,The floor plan changes are very powerful,1
9382,You can get into a lot of creativity or trouble,0
9383,"For example, depending on where you place your curser you end up with angled walls or you move the whole wall",0
9384,It took me a bit of time to learn the precise location but it is a very nice option,0
9385,2/9/2012 UPDATE I continue to use this program and appreciate the products it can produce,0
9386,This last week I discovered a new thing it can do that I found extremely useful,1
9387,"There are times when you draw an object in another program, such as powerpoint, that blows apart when you try to move it",0
9388,I discovered that you can take a copy of the graphic and plop it onto a blank page in Smart Draw and it copies as a picture,0
9389,"From there, save it as a sdr file, go back and so save as, and pick your image format--I usually use jpg",0
9390,"As with any sdr file, you can adjust the density and size of the image when you save it",0
9391,This worked perfectly for me and when I imported the jpg into another program (in this case MS Word) it behaved perfectly,1
9392,"Of course, you can do the same thing with a photo editing program like PaintShop Pro or Photo Shop but this is quick and easy and if you already have the program open is it is quick and easy",1
9393,9/10/2011 UPDATE I am currently working on a project that requires a great deal of data analysis,0
9394,"I typically have the same data i Exel, SPSS and sometimes in txt format",0
9395,I am working with data with a large number of cases or smaller ones with many data points,0
9396,"I have to analyze the data, convert it into to a variety of visual formats and then save it as a 8MB or larger file for publication",0
9397,I can graph in multiple programs,0
9398,I typically move the data to SmartDraw the graphical presentation because it has the most control over the presentation of the data and is easy to convert to large jpg files,0
9399,"However, there are three things that are truly bothersome",0
9400,As I and others have noted the program crashes a lot,0
9401,My office partners are used to me throwing my hands into the air and rolling my chair back while I wait for the program to restart,0
9402,"On the positive side, when it does restart my stuff is still there",1
9403,"My computer should have enough power to run a program like this so I believe the ""crash-o--matic"" aspect of it is in the program",0
9404,"Secondly, it is hard to change the font size on graphs",0
9405,You should be able to select one of the sibling boxes and change the text in all,0
9406,While I can make this happen sometimes it is not reliable which necessitates changing box by box,0
9407,"That said, I still think it is a good program",0
9408,Doing the sort of thing I do is not trivial so having to wrestle with a program is not uncommon regardless of the program I use,0
9409,My criteria is whether or not the program will ultimately produce what I want,0
9410,I can answer affirmatively that Smart Draw does that for me,0
9411,7/24/2011 UPDATE I have been using VP for several months now and have changed my 5 to 4 stars,0
9412,It is still a versatile program and allows you to do a lot of different things with only a little technical skill,0
9413,"However, I think the previous versions were easier to use when you wanted to do a range of different types of graphics",0
9414,I have found that the libraries are harder to work in and it seems to me that there were things I used to use that are not there now,0
9415,"Of course, backwards memory is always risky but I think there were ;-)",0
9416,"I would still buy this program, and I am glad that I have it",1
9417,"However, I strongly urge people to figure out what you want your program to do",1
9418,"As other reviewers have mentioned, Visio is better or that is better",0
9419,"I still believe that the ""better"" aspects are based on what you use the program for",0
9420,I think Smart Draw is a very good choice if you use a lot of different types of graphics (e,0
9421,"brochures, charts, fliers, landscapes, etc)",0
9422,I do not think it is the best choice if you use one or a few types of graphics because there are limits and trade offs in usability to offer the range of modules,0
9423,"3/30/2011 ORIGINAL REVIEW

THE BASIS OF MY REVIEW
Some reviewers cautioned that the highly ranked reviews were ""shill"" because people did not purchase the program through Amazon, and/or that they only had one review posted",0
9424,I cannot speak to those reviews but I can speak to my review,0
9425,Upfront I will state that I did not purchase my copies from Amazon because I needed multiple seats and that was not available through Amazon,0
9426,I decided to review SmartDraw here since Amazon is a very important place to share product experiences,0
9427,"My review is based on frequent use of 2007, 2009 and recently with VP (2010)",0
9428,"I routinely purchase from, and review products on, Amazon",0
9429,I always try to write the type of review that provides information to help people decide if a product is one they will like,0
9430,"I am far from the most frequent or popular reviewer but I have a good track record on ""helpfulness"" votes",0
9431,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I affirm that I have not received any economic or other benefits from SmartDraw",0
9432,I have no friends or family members who work for SmartDraw,0
9433,This review is entirely my opinion,0
9434,"I LIKE SMARTDRAW VERY MUCH
I think SmartDraw is a very good program and a good investment",1
9435,I also think there are issues to consider,0
9436,"After thinking carefully of its pluses and minuses for me, I decided to give it a 5 star rating because in my opinion the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses",0
9437,"I have experienced a few limitations, some of which turn out to be lack of knowledge of the program, some that are idiosyncrasies of the program, some that are just unhelpful, and some that hopefully will fade with time",0
9438,"Having reviewed other programs, SmartDraw is the most versatile program of commercial or freeware that I have found",0
9439,I am a researcher and being able to analyze data in various visual methods teaches me about my data and provides ways to show others what the data are saying,0
9440,There is a problem with VP that I hope will fade away but have no assurance that it will,-1
9441,"For reasons I do not understand, the SmartDraw company decided to create the new version (VP) so that it is not backwards compatible",0
9442,This forces you to upgrade/purchase any seat that is using the images created or edited in VP,0
9443,I have provided more detail below on all of my concerns,0
9444,This has happened with other programs (e,0
9445,transitioning from Word 3,0
9446,0 to Word 1997) and fixes have followed,0
9447,Hopefully there will be a fix and the problem will fade away,0
9448,Some reviewers have said that Visio is better,0
9449,As one reviewer correctly pointed out there is far more information available for book and community tech support than for SmartDraw,0
9450,I agree that for some functions Visio is a great choice,1
9451,"However, there are things that SmartDraw does do that Visio does not",0
9452,I used Visio in the past and know that it is a very powerful program,0
9453,It did not meet my needs for the type of scientific data analysis and graphing that I do,0
9454,"By comparison, SmartDraw is probably not a good choice for company IT management like Visio is",0
9455,I think it is important to consider what you want to do with a program and then match those needs to your software,0
9456,"THE PROGRAM

PROS
1",0
9457,"Multiple Graphic/Visual Analysis Module In One Program
SmartDraw is unique in that it combines multiple types of graphics in one program",0
9458,SmartDraw is excellent for visual data analysis and creating graphics to display that data,1
9459,"I can be very good for planning and designing things like electrical systems, house plans, computer programs, and even landscaping",1
9460,Perhaps the most important outcome of this multi-module design is that you can enter data once and then use it across multiple types data presentation,0
9461,"For example, you can put data in, display it in the graphing/charging functions and with one click display the exact data in the mind map module",0
9462,I have been able to find programs that are alternatives to one or a few of the modules but none that work across so many modules,0
9463,"Additionally, when using multiple programs, linking them together is very time-consuming",0
9465,"Data Analysis, Not Just Data Presentation
SmartDraw is not a just a graphics program",0
9466,"It is that, plus a data analytic tool",0
9467,I use it in combination with a statistical program and it allows me to understand and display my data in ways I cannot with the statistical package alone,0
9469,"Helps Convey Complex Thoughts to Others
SmartDraw allows me to construct graphic images to convey unusual or complex information to others",0
9471,"Can Create Very Dense Files for Publication
You can create very large, dense graphics that are excellent for publication",0
9472,We often write monographs and reports that are done in color and on good paper,0
9473,We need incredibly large images (3-8 MB each)to have the quality necessary for these publications and for scientific posters,0
9474,It is quite easy to do this with SmartDraw once you figure it out,1
9475,I have never found any program that is similar for data analysis,0
9476,You can draw lovely graphics for publications but you can also display information in analytic methods,0
9477,"CONS
While I have listed a lot of cons here, they are most important for casual users",-1
9478,"For serious users, there are generally ones that can be chalked up to idiosyncratic program quirks",0
9479,"Like most program, these quirk are things you learn to work around but are sometimes things that are downright infuriating",0
9480,"In my experience, some of the problems I have had were related to needing a deep knowledge of the program so you can figure out how to do it or find a decent work-around",0
9481,A couple of the cons are serious,0
9482,"I also agree totally with reviewer that said SmartDraw is not a good program for serious, competent graphics designers",0
9483,"SmartDraw is a combination of ""get it done"" and sophisticated options",0
9484,"You can really do a lot with things program but it probably is not a substitute full-bore, full time, graphics designs",0
9485,It can be a great part of a larger toolkit,1
9487,"Advertised As ""Simple,"" But In Reality It Is Not A Program For Casual Users
SmartDraw is a multi-competence level program that can be hard to use for more complex graphics",0
9488,It is not for casual users unless you want to use a pre-packaged item and just fill in their blanks,0
9490,"Help Functions are Either Very Basic or Sometimes Hard To Find
The ""Smart Help"" feature is nice but the information provided is the very beginning level helpful to those who are ""filling in the blanks",0
9491,""" Not unlike some other programs, finding advanced help can be frustrating because what SmartDraw calls a function is not always intuitive",0
9492,Sometimes the information is not in the help files,0
9494,"Sometimes Overly Aggressively Automated
There are times that I cannot understand what is happening with with my graphic or how to enter and manage my data",0
9495,The automated aspects of SmartDraw can be aggressive; it may reset parameters when you do not want it to do that,0
9496,It can be tiresome to track these down so you can figure out what is amiss,0
9497,This is improved in VP,0
9498,The Gantt Chart module is an excellent example of the problem,0
9499,"Sometimes you set date parameters and SmartDraw ""fixes"" later dates by sending them to the default",0
9501,"Sometimes Limits the Complexity of the Data You Can Display
At times the program will not accept the parameters I want to use",0
9502,"For example, top level and sublevels can be difficult to display and sometimes you cannot force the program to analyze and display sublevel data",0
9504,"Can Be Buggy
SmartDraw can be buggy",0
9505,"You can be doing something and poof, the program shuts down",0
9506,"If you have good ""save"" habits, the crash is a bother, but usually not fatal",0
9507,Sometimes it can be a bigger issue,0
9508,The file may lose its association with SmartDraw even though the extension is actually on the file,0
9509,"As a result of the uncoupling, your files look like text files so you cannot easily spot them",0
9510,"If you can find the file you have to open SmartDraw, navigate to the file, and then open it",0
9511,You cannot click on the file itself,0
9512,"It also disappears from all locations of ""recent docs"" so it appears to be completely gone even if it is there",0
9513,A little experience and you can find the files but it can be baffling at first,0
9515,No Backwards Compatibility (see more below),0
9516,SmartDraw VP is not backwards compatible with previous versions,0
9517,"SMARTDRAW VP IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
In a crisis moment, I ended up purchasing VP and *then* discovered that it was not backwards Not only had I created new images that could not be used on my other machines where I have 2009, I effectively destroyed my ability to access graphics that I had made minor changes on in VP",0
9518,I do intend to upgrade all of my machines but for now cannot afford to do that so am stuck with a very difficult problem,0
9519,I hope there is a fix soon,0
9520,"MOVING LICENSE FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER
One commenter pointed out you can be forced into purchasing a new version if you change computers",0
9521,This can be a thorny problem,0
9522,"When I had these difficulties, I had the presence of mind to enlisted the help of SmartDraw tech support",0
9523,I own two seats (one for desktop and one for laptop),0
9524,I decommissioned my old desktop and then could not install SmartDraw on my new desktop since I was effectively requesting three seats,0
9525,"After we identified the problem, Tech Support canceled my registration for the decommissioned desktop which allowed me to install it on my new machine",0
9526,My problem was solved in just a few minutes,0
9527,"TECH SUPPORT
Some reviewers say that they have had problems with tech support",0
9528,My own experience is that they have been very helpful and meet my criteria for really good support,0
9529,"I recognize that you do have to have the ""premium"" version to get the tech support I have",0
9530,"I have purchased ""premium"" tech support on other programs and have not been as satisfied as I am with SmartDraw",0
9531,"Here is why I like them:

1",1
9532,They answer the phone quickly and you get a real person,0
9533,It is possible to understand the accents of the tech support personnel,0
9534,I understand that English and Spanish language support is available,0
9535,They listen patiently while you explain the issue and do not assume what it is or that you do not know what you are talking about,0
9536,They stick with you while you try to solve the problem,0
9537,"They are downright honest in saying things like, ""Yes, it would be good if it did that but it does not",0
9539,They will do phone support follow-up by email from a real person,0
9540,Typically you can stay with the same tech support person through the resolution of a problem,0
9541,"UPDATE 3/31/2011
I discovered today that since I bought the premium tech support package it includes upgrade ""protection"" so I get a free upgrade on VP",0
9542,I was very happy that I purchased the premium package,1
9543,I cannot say much more than the other unsatisfied reviews here have said,0
9544,Support and communication with this company are terrible,-1
9545,Very snobby all around,-1
9546,I have gone back to VISIO 2010,0
9547,"Just as easy if not easier, more widespread, mainstream support, tons of books and training materials readily available and affordable",0
9548,Support is simple and easy to get on the MS site and from other popular established public VISIO sites,1
9549,All around,0
9550,this product had its day but since it costs as much as VISIO but offers less,0
9551,why bother?,0
9552,After easily downloading a trial version of SmartDraw VP we were able to create a relatively accurate scaled floor plan to present to the boss that afternoon,0
9553,"This program was very easy to use, with an on-screen FAQ database that gives immediate answers to rectify all uncertainties encountered",1
9554,"In addition to floor plans, the range of applications for this software is huge, so for just under $200 bucks I'd definitely agree with what the pros over at c-net are all raving about",0
9555,"My only gripe is the inability to scale down every single to-the-inch measurement with total accuracy, but for the price it certainly serves most every purpose I would ever have",0
9556,I recently upgraded from SmartDraw 2010 to VP,0
9557,I originally purchased the product about a year ago to use on a specific project where I needed some unique visuals and project management tools,0
9558,"It worked well for that, particularly the Mind-map feature",1
9559,"When I had another project come up recently, I was presented with the offer to upgrade to VP; all I can say is wow!  The new version is beautiful, has more options, and more example templates",0
9560,"Without even thinking about the help function, I jumped right in and was making complex figures in no time",0
9561,One really unique feature I really like is the export feature,1
9562,"For example, say you are working in a Word document and need to add a mind map diagram",0
9563,You can fire up VP and create the figure,0
9564,"Using the export to Word option, the figure will be copied to the Word document where your cursor was placed when you left the document - a really handy feature",0
9565,"Overall, recommend highly for spicing up your communications and other reports",1
9566,"The VP to me stands for ""Very Poor""

This used to be the best drawing application out there -- at least when I first started to use it (back in 1997)",0
9567,"Sadly, its best days are waayyy behind it",0
9568,"This application started out as shareware, reasonably priced, with free support and a 30 day trial period",0
9569,No more,0
9570,"Now the cost is way up, the trial period is 7 days and real support is a ""Premium"" feature",0
9571,Smartdraw's market focus has shifted to large corporations seeking a charting wizard for PowerPoint,0
9572,"Smartdraw's list of lost features speaks to the decline and fall of this application:
-multiple floating libraries
-photo-editor plug-in
-user online space for sharing drawings
-hundreds of free graphics libraries
-support for postscript fonts
-etc",1
9575,"It is user-unfriendly, black-boxish and not for the creative",0
9576,"I was ""suckered"" into upgrading -- you see, I just got a new computer and needed to re-install Smartdraw",0
9577,But the Smartdraw website blocked the download of my previous version and offered me a deal to upgrade to VP,0
9578,It was no deal,0
9579,Steer clear of this software and don't be taken in by deals or shill reviews,0
9580,"Over the past few days I have been utilizing the Free Trial version of this software, typically for my drawings I use Visio which in some ways is more complicated to use, but in others makes much more sense",0
9581,"As an example; the software by SmartDraw allows you to create a room via dimensions, but when those dimensions are not round numbers the software will automatically round up or round down creating the inability to totally decide what your actual space is",0
9582,Another noticeable fact is that several of the pre-designed shapes such as Cubicles are poorly created,0
9583,If you break them down into the individual components (un-grouping) they become misaligned requiring several more steps to make them appear correct,0
9584,"Additionally, lining up objects is a difficult task, each object wants to snap to grid, but for whatever reason the grid is different for each object",0
9585,"I can't wait to get Visio, just ordered moments ago",0
9586,I would recommend staying away from this product,1
9587,"I have been using SmartDraw VP now for several months, and what strikes me about it is that it is totally different than anything else out there",0
9588,"Traditional graphics software makes me have to drag and drop, and draw, to create my visuals",0
9589,"SmartDraw does everything pretty much automatically, so you can do it much faster and things always looks good",1
9590,"If you are an expert graphics designer you might want to stick with something else, but if you are like me, and new to creating business visuals of all kinds, then I would highly recommend this product",0
9591,"You can get up to speed very quickly, and the visuals you create for presentations and meetings look professional (and make you look good too!)",1
9592,I downloaded the demo and made a network diagram with relative ease,0
9593,I liked the icons and the general features,1
9594,"There were a few bugs in terms of icons showing up, placing icons and copying icons",0
9595,Many times nothing would show up or duplicates that were not selected would get copied,0
9596,It was an annoyance but somewhat forgivable,-1
9597,"So after making my entire network diagram I opened it up again the next day only to find that the program was now refusing to open it up, saying that it was unable to open the file, it either doesn't exist or I am low on hard drive space",0
9598,Obviously neither assertion was true,0
9599,"I couldn't find any information about this on their support site, but a google search turned up another potential fix, switching your default print driver",0
9600,"I did try this and it still didn't work, but apparently, this problem should have been mostly fixed in 2010",0
9601,So now I have a worthless file that I can't even print to a pdf,0
9602,"Thanks smartdraw!

To make matters worse the reviews here are suspect since the majority of them only have one product in their portfolio",1
9603,And their quoted ratings on their website are still blatantly false! They are trying to claim they have a 5 star rating on Amazon! It's always a bad sign when a company spends their time trying to gain unwarranted publicity for their product instead of trying to make the product better,0
9604,On a final note any vector based program such as Illustrator or Corel can do what this program offers and more! And the sad fact is that they can usually be had for the same money or less,0
9605,"I downloaded the trial version yesterday evening and spent 3 hours just trying to erect the four walls of a rectangular warehouse from scratch (not using one of the warehouse templates, which seemed even more confusing to me since they were the wrong dimensions, contained a lot of unnecessary things, etc",0
9606,"The help area had no information for me regarding whether the software allowed a user to initially (and simply) indicate the length and width of a rectangular room, without having to laboriously construct each of the 4 walls, which never could be brought to the right length, despite hours of manipulation",0
9607,I also wanted to include the support poles in the design that appear every 19 feet throughout the space,0
9608,There was no graphic for this in the included library,0
9609,"No doubt the software probably works as claimed, but due to the frustration I experienced, it appears that one needs extensive training before becoming an expert user",0
9610,I gave up and deleted the trial copy,0
9611,"I came to Amazon to see the reviews before I bought the product, if you look at the reviews:

Great Product with Powerful Automation ,Powerful business tool and The First Visual Processor they were all written on July 29th",0
9612,If you review their other reviews you will see they all reviewed the Smartdraw 2010 all on the same date of April 28th or 29th,0
9613,It is obvious they are creating shill reviews,0
9614,"Also view professional visuals for reports, professional visuals for reports, papers and more in only minutes whom created their review on August 2, 2010 and also reviewed Smartdraw 2010 on April 28, 2010 just like the three noted above",0
9615,"This also makes me wonder if the review Better Than Before also created on August 2, 2010 is a real customer review",0
9616,There are two other 5 star reviews and I can not help but wonder if they were real customer reviews,0
9617,"I am very disappointed, I was very interested in this product (except for the price) and now that it is obvious that the reviews are not real customer reviews I will not try this product!",-1
9618,Don't touch this product,-1
9619,"Not because of the product, but because of the new licensing arrangements",0
9620,They have changed their arrangements out of the blue to stop you downloading your paid for product and want you to pay $60+ for the privilege,0
9621,I have been a very loyal customer for a number of years and have probably spent $1000 on this product in the last 4 years but their new licences are a gouge of their existing customers,0
9622,I for one will not be buying their product again,0
9623,If they do it once they will do it again,0
9624,Wonderful software,1
9625,Very easy to use!,1
9626,Great product for any quilter!,1
9627,Absolutely the best aid for quilter who are tired of cutting individual triangels and then piecing them together,1
9628,Using a printer and Bear Claw Triangulations a quilter can have all her completed triangles done in little time,0
9629,Precise and easy to use,1
9630,This has made making triangles so much easier! I can enjoy seeing a finished quilt so much sooner,0
9631,So loved this and continue to use it for different quilting blocks,1
9632,Was introduced to this by my quilting class and so pleased,0
9633,Many of my quilter friends in my guild own and rave about this software,0
9634,"It was introduced to us in a participation block for half-square
triangles and I was amazed at how perfect my square was",0
9635,I would recommend this program to every quilter,1
9636,Very basic program,0
9637,but use it often!,0
9638,Though Triangulations 3,0
9639,"0 claims to work with both Macs and PCs, it does NOT work with Macs",0
9640,"For many of the sizes it will fail to print the last eighth to quarter of an inch of the necessary image, which makes the program rather useless",0
9641,The most frustrating part is that BearPaw Productions will not answer emails nor return phone calls regarding this problem,-1
9642,'nuff said,0
9643,"I recently purchased the Triangulation 3 CD by Brenda Hemming, and made by Bear Paw Productions and I love it!  After inserting the CD into the computer, PDF files download and you can save it onto your computer",0
9644,"These are great!  I had seen copies of triangle papers that you could buy in sheets, and I thought that was a great idea, but I didn't want to have to keep buying more triangle paper",1
9645,"With Triangulations, you can scroll through the PDF files and find any size you want to make and just print them on your home printer",0
9646,"Easy enough for me!  With this CD, you can print half-square triangles, quarter square triangles, and flying geese",1
9647,"The flying geese can be printed in a column or individually, and the other nice thing about this CD is that you can print patterns to the 1/16th of an inch!  I used to hate the process of making so many individual half-square triangles by themselves, but now I am actually looking for patterns with lots of triangles in them",0
9648,I think this is so fun and fast!,1
9649,I think this product is just great for giving me accuracy in my piecing of half square and quarter square triangle units as well as flying geese,1
9650,I have a lot of trouble getting accuracy with my points due to sewing on the bias,0
9651,Not with this product,0
9652,"I like it better than a lot of other triangle piecing products, because I am not sewing on long, skinny strips, which are unstable",1
9653,This uses larger squares of fabric for more stability,0
9654,"There are lots of sizes available on the CD, so you'll likely find the size you need",0
9655,There are also four pretty quilt patterns,0
9656,"With the variety of paper piecing patterns available, it's well worth the money",0
9657,A detailed review is available on my blog: [,0
9658,I just got this program three days ago and their speech recognition is awesome,0
9659,I also like the complete beginner level and the fact that I can transfer the audio files with the click of a button to my desktop,1
9660,"I'm a homeschooling mother of 6, and I have been trying to teach my 15 year old daughter Spanish since she was born",0
9661,"She has been resisting, and resentful about it",0
9662,"When I gave her the Tell Me More software, she was interested and engaged immediately",0
9663,"It's not perfect, but it is fun and educational",2
9664,Here are some pros and cons of the software,0
9665,"Pros:
* three different modes
* four distinct levels
* voice recognition feature
* easy to navigate
* fun
* dictionary feature

Cons:
* assumes knowledge of verb conjugation
* pronunciation exercises have no clear-cut end
* complete beginner level feels more intermediate than beginner
* word search sections assume you know the written form of words you've only just heard; assumes a large vocabulary",2
9666,I have just completed Rosetta Stone Spanish Latin American-level 1,0
9667,"I thought it was okay but I was looking for more conversational Spanish and I found Rosetta Stone to be lacking in the area of conversational Spanish, providing vocabulary words to review, and the content in level 1 was slightly too sophomoric for my opinion",0
9668,"As a result I did research on the web read reviews and discovered that ""tell me more"" was the best rated on Amazon and other review websites",0
9669,"I was very disappointed in the product, I found the software was not user friendly and I'm very computer literate",-1
9670,I was not interested in doing crossword puzzles and grammar exercises yet I could not complete the guided course work without it,0
9671,when I went to free roam mode I found that there was not enough opportunity for the program to allow me to listen and repeat dialogue it was amazingly cumbersome just to make progress in anything compared to Rosetta stone,0
9672,"Additionally I'm not that interested in learning grammatical structure I want to hear people speaking, read the words and learn via  picture, association and repetition",0
9673,Also it did not have the dynamic learning mode this was also disappointing,0
9674,"I also discovered that the software was last produced in 2004, outdated",0
9675,"In  speech recognition mode it kept going and going and I get no feedback as to whether I was finished, it kept going no matter how many times I tried; it said my pronunciation was moderate while other speech recognition software showed my pronunciation to be good after practicing",0
9676,In summary I hated my experience and return the product immediately,0
9677,"I wish Rosetta Stone had more conversational Spanish and reviewed topics of conversation that were slightly more adult oriented for level 1, I'm hoping level two is better as I'm going to purchase Rosetta Stone immediately",0
9678,"Please note everyone learns differently and has different expectations I was just surprisingly shocked at how difficult it was to make progress and really jump right in learning listening and repeating, it's just not for me maybe it could be something you like?",0
9679,The Tell Me More Spanish Program is the hands down best program that I have ever used,0
9680,I felt as if I actually learned more using this program than the others,0
9681,"I primarily use what Auralog refers to as the ""Dynamic mode",0
9682,""" This is an adaptive method that actually does a pretty good job of gauging what you've grasped and on what you need to work with more",0
9683,"This is highly configurable language learning software in that you can choose to isolate your program to Comprehension, Expression, Vocabulary, and Grammar or choose Complete, which gives you a mixed bag",0
9684,You can also choose to have the instructions in English or go totally immersive and get the instructions in Spanish,0
9685,You also may choose European Spanish or Latin American Spanish though the primary focus is European Spanish,0
9686,"There is a built in dictionary, translator, grammar explainer and links to numerous on line sites although the Club Auralog site is sporadic",0
9687,Tell Me More is Flash based so you must have Flash installed on you system,0
9688,But they used it well and I really do have fun using the program,1
9689,My experience with customer support located in Arizona has been excellent which is a relief since Auralog is a French company,0
9690,"One note, if you are a rank beginner - don't know one word of Spanish - scared of foreign language type, you might be better served if you start out with all the pictures in Rosetta Stone",0
9691,"But if you have a bit of knowledge and are serious, Tell Me More is definitely the fun and interesting way to go",0
9692,And ultimately well worth the investment,1
9693,"I really wanted to learn Spanish for more than just vacations, but more to communicate and better myself",0
9694,"Indeed, knowing Spanish is getting more and more important right now",0
9695,"I wanted to learn on my own and did a lot of research to find the best Spanish learning tool available, tried several demos of different products, asked to various teachers",0
9696,"I even had Spanish speaking people try out the demos with me so I can have a feedback of what would be most effective!

At first, I was interested in audio CDs (Pimsleur,",0
9697,") so I could learn in my car, or at home, fast and on the go, but I realized after trying that it will help me with my vocabulary maybe but I will never be able to get an intermediate level with audio CDs",0
9698,"Then, I looked for software, as it probably has the most potential for self-learning",0
9699,I visited several websites with reviews like about,0
9700,"com, toptenreviews",0
9702,"I tried and was mailed different demos and really fell that TeLL me More was the best product for me, it has so many activities, and the speech recognition was really what I was looking as being able to speak was important",0
9703,"I could not see myself reach a high level with Rosetta Stone, as it was very basic and repetitive and seems to only consist of pictures over and over again",0
9704,Other software seemed really inferior,0
9705,"This new Premium version is great as it has all the levels in the same package so I did not need to worry about buying several packages, or even a headset and microphone as it includes one",0
9706,"It also has an audio CD, which was a nice bonus",0
9707,"I already went through the Complete Beginner and was really amazed by the number of activities available: picture word association, crossword puzzles, videos, pronunciation,",0
9708,"Also, the speech activities really helped me with my pronunication, which was terrible at first! I really enjoyed the Grammar too as I could not find another software with grammar",0
9709,I plan on buying another TeLL me More software to try to learn French next time,0
9710,I love this language software,1
9711,"It has everything to learn Spanish, a lot of different acitivities, videos",0
9712,My favorite part is the speaking part,1
9713,"The software comes with a headset and microphone, and you can actually have a dialogue with the computer",0
9714,I was also really excited about the audio CD and the possibility to play the audio content on my ipod,1
9715,This is the best Spanish software I ever tried,1
9716,"This software is the biggest waste of time, money and hope, EVER!

The time it took to read about it, decide to buy it, receive it then use it",-1
9717,The money spent(nearly $300 dollars) on the purchase,0
9718,"Finally your hopes dashed as you start out in the ""Complete Beginner"" level",0
9719,"THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS, NOR IS IT FOR INTERMEDIATE OR ADVANCED LEARNERS!

It has no learning structure or logical learning steps",-1
9720,It's practically a TV show put together with some crosswords and other useless exercises,0
9721,I cannot beleive a company that boasts million dollar contracts with large companies (Renault-Nestle-Siemens-Toyota etc,0
9722,) can deliver such a horrid learning program to the public,-1
9723,AT LEAST ROSETTA STONE HAS A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE,0
9724,"Tell me More's aim is your money, not your acquisition of a new language",0
9725,"Take it from me, find a good and reasonably priced tutor or learning center and get started from there",0
9726,"Heres a good tip: Purchase AT&T Natural Voices Text to Speech engine with the spanish voice ""Rosa"" and use that to listen to written text",0
9727,It's good practice,1
9728,SO DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!! DONT BUY THIS!!!!,-1
9729,I was fortunate to learn french in France over a two year period in Strasbourg,0
9730,One of the biggest concerns I had leaving was I would lose all the French I had learned,-1
9731,I was a little skeptical at first when the representative from Auralog promised that I could actually improve my French while living in the U,0
9732,", but I am happy to say that it is true!  I have been using this product for the last 4 months and have never been happier",0
9733,After a recent visit to Geneva I can tell you that I actually improved my French while living in the United States,0
9734,Tell Me More fills in the biggest gap in learning any language: oral production,0
9735,Even while in one of the best language schools in Strasbourg I rarely had the opportunity to speak,0
9736,Tell Me More addresses it through their voice recognition software which measures your speech compared to a native speaker,0
9737,The modules are varied and can be customized to your level and needs,0
9738,What I really like about the program is its variety and the fact you can follow the program at your own pace,1
9739,"If you want my 2 cents (and I did a lot of research in this area), this is flat out the best language program out there!",1
9740,"Redshift 7 Premium is running perfectly on
my Fujitsu, Vista Home Premium computer",0
9741,"This is, in my opinion, by far the best
astronomy software on the market",1
9742,"I have
tryed a lot of them!

It is the most versatiled of them all",1
9743,"You can change most everything to suit Your
way of using the software",0
9744,"A nice feature is, where other softwares uses
a picture of the sky as background, Redshift
lets the computer generate every star and other
objects whit its own motion",1
9745,"Peter Andersson
Sweden",0
9746,"I can't believe that this NEW product is apparently incompatible with Vista!! Shades of Redshift 5, whose users were left with software that has severe problems in the Vista environment, or forced to upgrade to Redshift 6, which was never sold in the US",0
9747,One can only hope that the WINDOWS XP limitation tag on this product is an oversight and it is actually capable of running in a Vista environment,0
9748,"If so, who is responsible for this gross oversight and how do you expect to sell this product in the 21st century?",0
9749,"SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OPENING VIDEO WITHOUT A GRAPHIC OR VIDEO CARD IN MY INTEL SYSTEM",0
9750,"NOW THAT SYSTEM IS UP AND RUNING , SEEMS TO BE FINE",0
9751,"IN NEAR FUTURE WILL UPDATE MY CURRENT SYSTEM WITH ACTUAL GRAPHIC CARD TO AVOID FUTHER
PROBLEMS",0
9752,"THE ONLY FACT THAT WAS NOT LISTED WITH PRODUCT , THAT VIDEO WOULD NEED DIRECT COMMAND
FROM VIDEO PROGRAM IF NO GRAPHIC CARD WAS AVAILABLE IN COMPUTER",0
9753,"Before I start, let me state I've been a computer techie for the last 20+ years",0
9754,When I first started Windows was only a dream and you had your choice of DOS and IBM compatible (both of which were really the same thing in the broadest definition),0
9755,"Needless to say, things have changed slightly",0
9756,"You now have Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux with DOS still hanging on for dear life (and  if you're a real techie, try UNIX)",0
9757,"I gave up on Windows when Vista came out and although I like OS X, Apple's stranglehold on computers running their OS has made that proposition a tad expensive",0
9758,"Enter Linux, the poor man's Windows",0
9759,"Yes, you can get a thousand different flavors but Ubuntu is probably one of the best (along with Suse) for each of use",0
9760,"For example:

*  I recently had a computer which had Vista installed",0
9761,Something corrupted the OS and the manufacturer was nice enough to send me an install disk when their built in rescue partition failed,0
9762,After 4 hours of waiting and answering numerous inane questions I finally had my computer back once I popped in the installation disk,0
9763,The only problem was it no longer recognized the video and sound cards nor would it acknowledge the wireless card,0
9764,I downloaded the necessary drivers from the manufacturer only to have Vista reject them,0
9765,After a few more hours of tweaking and just about losing my religion I finally got things working,0
9766,That lasted about two weeks before the OS got funky again and started losing programs such as Quicken and the final straw was when it couldn't find my printer even though it was right there in the printers dialog box,0
9767,"*  As luck would have it, I have ordered an Ubuntu disk from the manufacturer and had just received it",0
9768,From the time I popped it in until the time it was ready took roughly 20 minutes,0
9769,"Yes, 20 minutes!  It not only recognized my NVIDIA video card and Broadcom wireless card it even downloaded the drivers to make sure both worked",0
9770,I then tempted fate and plugged in my Samsung USB laser printer,0
9771,"Nothing happened, or so I thought",0
9772,"Upon looking I realized it had found the printer and had already installed it!  Took all of about 5 seconds!

For those of you who are afraid to abandon Windows for Ubuntu you can go two ways -- the live CD or merely tell Ubuntu to partition the disk so you can still keep Windows",0
9773,"Simple as that!

By the way, you have to option to install a bazillion free programs (actually closer to 5,000), many of which emulate comparable Windows programs",0
9774,"You'd probably spend closer to $50,000 to get the similar Windows programs",0
9775,"So, do the math",0
9776,"You can pay $12 for this DVD (or get it free from the developer) or you can pay $100 to $300 for Windows Vista or $129 or so for Mac OS X (although you'll have to shell out another $1,000 or so for the Apple computer to go along with the latter OS)",0
9777,This is one of thousands of linux flavors,0
9778,The difference between each is the packages (i,0
9779,the software applications) that come preinstalled,0
9780,"Ubuntu is aimed toward everyday users, but can easily be made to be a developer's paradise",0
9781,"I recommend this over Windows as the Ubuntu community has excellent support of WiFi and graphics cards now, and because it's entirely free",0
9782,"If you are a small business owner, it'd be in your best interest to run linux with open source programs and save literally thousands on software licenses",0
9783,Download it free at [,0
9784,] or go to [,0
9785,] and download the torrent file of it,0
9786,Highly recommended,1
9787,"Wonderful Linux distro!  So easy to install and use, everything just works beautifully and all the software is free!  This Linux is way more user friendly than Windows",1
9788,It runs really fast on my old IBM Thinkpad notebook,1
9789,The software came nicely packaged and arrived sooner than promised,1
9790,"Nice job, guys!
Paul in Southern California",1
9791,"I bought this product (or so I thought) from the ""new & used"" page",1
9792,What I got was not the boxed set from Canonical,0
9793,I don't know if that was a fault of Amazon or the merchant,0
9794,"It turns out that I wanted a non-standard installation (dual-boot on a second hard drive), and I could REALLY have used the limited support mentioned by another reviewer",0
9795,Ubuntu is easy to use for a novice and powerful for a software engineer,1
9796,I am neither,0
9797,"To conclude on a positive note, I got it working and it is a very impressive-looking system",0
9798,I just hope I have the rough patch behind me,0
9799,"Ok just so you guys know I've tried several Linux distros before including fedora, puppy linux, debian, knoppix and others",0
9800,So far this is the best,1
9801,"it is the most user friendly, when you need a plugin it tells you and installs it for you",1
9802,if you try any linux distro try this one,0
9803,but one of the great things about it is that if you have acess to broadband you don't even have to pay for it you can download it for free from their web site (although if you pay for the box set you do get some tech support),0
9804,but if you do need help along the way you can also get free help on thier web fourms or mailing lists,0
9805,if you've used windows before it's easy enough to learn but remember it's not windows,0
9806,linux has it's strengths and weaknesses,1
9807,example of strength: linux doesn't get viruses,0
9808,example of weakness: it only runs some windows programs (although there are usually free alternatives),0
9809,I love Ubuntu,1
9810,I've been using it as my only operating system for my non-work laptop for about 3 years,0
9811,I'm never going back to Windows,-1
9812,But I'm a computer geek,0
9813,If you have to pay someone [,1
9814,"] to put a Linux distribution on a DVD for you, then Linux is not for you",0
9815,You can get this exact thing from [,0
9816,] for free,0
9817,"If you are not proficient enough with a computer to do that on your own, then you are not proficient enough with a computer to use Linux/Ubuntu",0
9818,10 was a great stepping stone but there have been at least two updates since this version came out,0
9819,I have used 9,0
9820,04 and had many issues resolved,0
9821,Now that 9,0
9822,10 is out I think it may be the best OS I have used,0
9823,And the best part is all Ubuntu OS are free online,1
9824,There is no copy right violations or stealing in any way,0
9825,There are numerous sites for support Linus/Ubuntu and if you can't find what you need just post a question and some geek will get back,0
9826,"I use the term ""Geek"" lovingly since these guys and gals really know their stuff, plus I am the proud father of a Geek, and are more than happy to help",0
9827,Ubuntu itself has frequent updates and support,0
9828,All the software that you may need or want is free and many of the products that other software vendors sell is free with Ubuntu,0
9829,Few programmers ask for a donation but even those will run properly without shelling out money,0
9830,I do believe in supporting those that work properly to encourage them to continue working on new projects,0
9831,"Anything that a MAC or Windows OS can do, Ubuntu can do also",0
9832,The difference is price,0
9833,Ubuntu is free! Plus if you're not afraid to get a little grease on your hands you can get under the hood and see what makes Linus tick,1
9834,"The problem is tearing yourself away from the free games suchas solitaire, suduka, free photo editing programs, cd/dvd programs (please note",0
9835,"I use the plural because there are so many), and Open Office for word processing, spread sheets and other productivity programs",0
9836,"Now the downside: If you can't borrow a copy from a friend, relative or library it may take a very long time to download",0
9837,I say borrow because Ubuntu encourages everyone to give copies to friends,0
9838,The biggest drawback in my opinion is that if are one that can not follow directions and read directions carefully then wait till your kids get home from school,0
9839,If you have an older machine this OS and any of the newer ones may not run correctly,0
9840,"My friend teaches grade school and has accumulated about two dozen donated computers, most using 98 or 98SE (Ver i386)",0
9841,All were DOA,0
9842,After obtaining a copy of Edubuntu (6,0
9843,1) she has resurrected these older machines and even has the USB ports working (which they did not work with MS older Operating Systems,0
9844,"Most of these older machines use the old floppy ""A"" drive and do not have CD readers/writers",0
9845,For younger kids its great,1
9846,"You give them a computer that is inexpensive, you control what they have access to and you keep them offline so they aren't exposed to what kids should not be exposed to",0
9847,If you know how to use the old DOS or even Basic languages you can figure out most Linus base systems,0
9848,If you don't want to play with the nuts and bolts you  probably won't have to,0
9849,If you are having trouble just ask your kids,0
9850,After four hours of fighting with a re-install of Windows XP I finally decided to switch to Ubuntu Linux,0
9851,"It loaded in about 15 minutes, I didn't have to load any additional drivers, and at this point, I'm able to make Ubuntu do everything I was doing in
Windows XP",0
9852,"The level of documentation out there on the web for Ubuntu is fantastic, and I was able to find and load all the necessary software packages for graphics, music, and movies, using the Ubuntu GUI",0
9853,"If you are tired of fighting with Windows,
and you just don't want to spend the $$$$$ for an Apple computer, this is a delightful alternative",0
9854,"I had hardware problems with my DVD writer, so I was unable to download Ubunto",0
9855,Purchasing the DVD from Amazon was the perfect solution,0
9856,"I have used Unix for decades at work, but have always had to ""deal"" with Windows, its viruses, its registry and its lockups",0
9857,"This Linux install was for home use and it is such a refreshing change! Installation was easy, it boots fast and my hard drive does not constantly grind with anti-virus activity",0
9858,Junk - Dont buy is my short suggestion,-1
9859,I bought this to install it on my newly bought Dell D600 which was already running Windows XP,0
9860,There were no problems with this laptop,0
9861,After installation when I tried to boot it gave me a kernel panic,0
9862,I googled this and discovered that there were about gazillion others who have had the same issue,0
9863,"There are solutions but I have not tried them yet - My chagrin is - this is sold as a product?  What kind of testing do these fellows do?  Mind you, this laptop that I installed it on is a pretty dated model - not new",0
9864,I am wondering if I should move to maybe Redhat or maybe Debian,0
9865,"When the cd arrived I thought great, till i tried to install it",0
9866,it dosent reformat  like a real operating system,0
9867,"?
it cannnot be read by windows?
it likes to sit in the cd draw and do nothing?",0
9868,"If you are tired of getting viruses and adware, and constantly dealing with errors and crashes, Linux may be the answer you are looking for",0
9870,Program crashes are less frequent,0
9871,"When programs do crash, they usually don't affect the rest of the OS",0
9872,"You won't have junk files and registry errors to worry about, and viruses and adware are simply a non-issue",0
9874,"Right out of the box, Ubuntu has multitudes more customization than Windows has ever offered",0
9875,"Anything from the interface (system tray, task list, menus) can be moved and arranged anywhere",0
9876,"Install Compiz Fusion and Emerald Theme Manager, and you'll expand your options even more",0
9877,You can literally trick out your whole operating system like a car in Need for Speed,0
9879,"You can have multiple desktops (Spaces), view all open windows (Expose), and even have a widget layer (Dashboard)",0
9880,*Some of this requires Compiz Fusion,0
9881,"- Installation of thousands of free software packages is a breeze using either of the 2 included ""package managers",0
9882,"""  You simply check off all the programs you want to install (and uncheck programs to uninstall), then hit OK and Ubuntu does everything for you",0
9883,"An array of additional packages are available for download, and can usually be installed easily with a",0
9884,deb installer,0
9885,"Popular commercial software such as Skype, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR, Google Picasa, Google Earth, and other great programs are available for Linux too",0
9887,"Having said all these great things, there are a few drawbacks",0
9888,There may come times where you do (unfortunately) need to run a specific Windows program that does not work in WINE,0
9889,You may want to leave windows installed alongside Ubuntu (dual-boot) so you have the option of falling back to it when absolutely necessary,0
9890,"DON'T BUY IT JUST YET!

There are several ways to get Ubuntu, and buying it from here may not best one for you",-1
9891,"Consider this:

- Ubuntu is a FREE download from [",0
9892,"When you buy this item on Amazon, you are paying for the physical disc and box, and for the convenience of having it all ready to install",0
9894,You can actually save money this way,1
9895,"For example, the Dell Mini 10 (at the time that I write this) is $50 cheaper when you choose Ubuntu instead of Windows",0
9896,"I am an Ubuntu user and proud of it, but I think it's sickening that someone is actually charging $13 for an OS that is not only meant to be free, BUT IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE AS A FREE DOWNLOAD ON Ubuntu's webpage",2
9897,"Yes, some sites sell DVDs for those who don't want to download it, but those usually only run a few bucks to cover the cost of burning and postage",0
9898,This is deplorable highway robbery,-1
9899,"If you are into open source operating systems but are a ""nerd"" or ""geek"" then Ubuntu is for you",0
9900,It is so popular just look at the new ABC show The Goode Family,1
9901,The son's name is Ubuntu,0
9902,lolcats!!! Yeah this is a great product for those wanting dive right into Linux,1
9903,I ordered this as a last ditch effort to save my old computer with Windows XP and full of expensive memory before I took it to the dump,0
9904,"It lost file after file and finally stopped, and the back up discs wouldn't save it",0
9905,Not even the repair guy could keep it running,0
9906,"I loaded the Ubuntu, and it took right off and loaded itself, and the computer is running like new",0
9907,"The Windows is gone, but so what",0
9908,"Lots of stuff there, a Photoshop-like program, etc",0
9909,"Only trouble is that it won't support a dialup internet connection, so I can't download the program to run my Minolta printer",0
9910,There was no warning about this in the product description,0
9911,I am happy though to get my computer working to do graphics that I can then print on my other computer,1
9912,"I wonder how many other people have thrown away perfectly good computers, not realizing it was the dratted Windows that was the problem",0
9913,"There is a Linux download to get dialup, but I am not a computer geek to figure it out",0
9914,"I give this 5 stars anyway, because it saved my computer for a little over $12",1
9915,I was disappointed  because the copy I received was burned and nowhere did the seller say it was to be a burned copy,-1
9916,"Other than that, the copy does work and Ubuntu is possibly one of the best versions of linux",0
9917,This program is available Free,0
9918,However the wait time is long,0
9919,"If you want it faster, this is the way to go",0
9920,There is a newer version available now which will no doubt be available from this vendor,0
9921,"I love this software!
It works perfectly on an HP laptop with a Centrino chip",1
9922,Older Pentium 4 I have tried don't have all the fxns- usually sound does not work,0
9923,I think the concept behind Ubuntu is something everyone can support,0
9924,"(except Microsoft/Apple employees, maybe)",0
9925,I switched to Ubuntu Linux after wrestling for months with a failing Windows installation,0
9926,I was pretty sure my hardware had gone bad and loaded Linux only as a last gasp attempt to find out what was wrong,1
9927,"To my surprise, I never had another failure",0
9928,Something had become corrupted in my Windows XP software,0
9929,"I might have been able to recover XP by formatting the disk and redoing Windows from scratch, but the prospect was pretty demoralizing",0
9930,"Now having said that, I don't want to mislead people into thinking that Linux will run without problems",0
9931,It might,0
9932,It might not,0
9933,"How successful you are will depend to a considerable degree on the various devices you have - video card, sound card, WiFi network card, scanner, printer, etc",0
9934,Many devices will work out of the box,0
9935,Some will work if you go through the effort of finding and installing drivers for them,0
9936,Some may even work better than with Windows,0
9937,"My Linux desktop and XP laptop will talk to each other fine, but my wife's Vista machine has trouble with both of the others",0
9938,Mileage varies,0
9939,"If you switch to Linux from Windows, be prepared to learn some new things",0
9940,The OS is not harder to use,0
9941,"In a great many ways, it presents the very same interface as Windows",0
9942,You'll see three little boxes in the upper right corner of each window that work the same as Windows,0
9943,You'll be able to use Alt-Tab to switch windows,0
9944,"Control-C, X, and V will work the same in many applications",0
9945,The mouse works the same,1
9946,"Firefox, Thunderbird, Open Office, and quite a few other applications will look and work the same as they do on Windows and, for most users, are just as good as the corresponding Microsoft software",0
9947,But you still must be prepared to learn some new things,0
9948,"The more you do, the more you'll find that you can do with Linux, including some nice things that aren't in Windows",0
9949,"If you feel awkward the first week, but are willing to learn a little, you'll be pretty comfortable by the second week and right at home after that",0
9950,"As others have said, a big advantage of Linux is that it's free",0
9951,This isn't just a benefit for initial cost,0
9952,"It also means you can upgrade your OS, your office suite, your picture viewers and editors, and most other stuff at no cost when the new versions come out",0
9953,"It also means that you don't see the same quantity of nagware, crippleware, spyware, adware, spambots and viruses that you see on Windows",0
9954,"And if you ever run into problems, you're free to switch to a newer or a different distribution without paying anyone a fee",0
9955,I loaded Ubuntu 8,0
9956,04 and was happy with it,1
9957,When 8,0
9958,10 came out I upgraded and was happier still,0
9959,"As of this writing, I'm now on 9",0
9960,04 and it all keeps getting better,0
9961,So far it all runs fine on my now five year old machine,0
9962,"--- Later ---
I've upgraded to 9",0
9963,"10, then 10",0
9964,4 64 bit on a new HP with AMD Athlon II with 4 CPUS,0
9965,It keeps improving,0
9966,"I was concerned about whether the 64 bit OS would be safe, but it appears to be fine",0
9967,I won't be going back to Windows any time soon,-1
9968,"--- Later ---
2013-03-10
My main workstation is now on Xubuntu 12",0
9969,4 and I've been experimenting with 12,0
9970,10 in a virtual machine,0
9971,"I switched from standard Ubuntu to Xubuntu when the ""Unity"" desktop environment came out",0
9972,"Xubuntu with its Xfce desktop seemed to me simpler, less glitzy, more to my taste",0
9973,The ability to switch desktops like this seems to me to be an advantage over Windows,0
9974,"The underlying Linux operating system and pretty much all of the applications are the same for Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce and other desktop environments, but you can choose what style of menus, icons, taskbars, window frames, etc",0
9975,", you want and usually customize them quite a bit too",0
9976,Windows still sets the standard for hardware manufacturers,0
9977,I was taken aback when my new Nexus 7 tablet used the Microsoft Media Transport protocol (MTP) for communication to a desktop computer and my Linux machine couldn't talk to it,0
9978,"However I was able to find MTP drivers created by a smart open source programmer, install them, and get back in touch with my tablet",0
9979,"But in spite of Microsoft's power over the manufacturers, things keep improving in the Linux world",0
9980,More and more hardware is supported,0
9981,When I bought an HP desktop with Windows 7 I was able shrink the Windows partition and install Ubuntu without a single hitch,0
9982,Everything just worked,1
9983,"I kept about 10% of the disk for Win 7 on the theory that I might someday have to run some software that wouldn't run on Linux, but so far it hasn't happened",0
9984,The only times I boot up Win 7 are when I have to reboot Linux anyway and figure I might as well install the latest Microsoft patches while I'm doing it,0
9985,"I still haven't paid one dime for software since 2008 and yet I prefer my Linux system over the Windows system I use at work, loaded with Windows, Office, Visual Studio, virus checkers, and other commercial programs",0
9986,"--- Later ---

9987,04 and still happy with Ubuntu,1
9988,The interfaces to MTP devices like Android phones and tablets is now built in to the system,0
9989,I no longer need the self-installed drivers,0
9990,I still recommend Linux,1
9991,"There's nothing on this DVD you can't download for free, but you might still wish to buy it for the convenience of having a disk and to send a little cash to Canonical, the sponsor of Ubuntu",0
9992,Ubuntu is a Linux operating system,0
9993,Ubuntu Linux is not a version of Windows even though it runs on the same kind of computer,0
9994,"If your computer was a radio, then Windows would be AM and Linux would be FM",0
9995,"You can use either one, but only one can be the native operating system at a time",0
9996,You can listen to news on AM radio and you can listen to news on FM radio but you can't listen to AM stations on FM,0
9997,"Generally, if your program runs only on Windows, it won't run on Linux",0
9998,"(If you look too closely at this analogy, it will fall to pieces from all the exceptions",0
9999,)  But that doesn't mean you can't get work done,0
10000,I like Ubuntu because I use it to to edit and layout a monthly newsletter with OpenOffice,1
10001,it is what it says it is,1
10002,"On the one hand, it's unfair of me to expect it to compete with today's newer software, OS's, etc",1
10003,"On the other hand, I can't imagine why, ever since I installed it, it's disc is all the sudden a necessity, not only to perform many MS Office 2000 functions, but also to uninstall most of my other software applications",-1
10004,Something's wrong with the installer,-1
10005,"I don't know, I don't work for MS, so I couldn't begin to guess as to why it's having problems -- it just is",-1
10006,"Still, I'm keeping it, as I like the user interface SO MUCH BETTER than the later versions",1
10007,"The menus are better, and they're that way be default",1
10008,You can't beat that,1
10009,"It is a little better than Office '97, which I have not missed since I finally upgraded to this",1
10010,"Yes, that's right, I'm a stick in the mud, and didn't upgrade until a few months ago, from '97 to 2000!!!!  Why?  Simple",0
10011,I stick with what works,0
10012,"Sometimes, these newer upgrades are just retarded",-1
10013,Give me my old user interface any day,0
10015,The order sheet was confusing or wrong,-1
10016,This isn't what I wanted at all,-1
10017,I wanted the Windows 2000 Operating System,0

10031,"I wanted the Professional version, but did not want to spend the amount the latest version would cost",0
10032,"I found out this version works on Windows 7, except for Outlook, which is the one thing in Office I don't use",1
10033,"Also, it did not require activation",1
10034,Newer versions are available but cost much more,-1
10035,This one does everything I need so why change what doesn't need changing,1
10036,"The good thing about Office 2000 is that it's cheap and much better than, say, Office 2007",1

10039,"If you have a High School diploma, Office 2000 is for you",0
10040,"The downside is that it has no protection from a particular form of malware called ""Office 2007"" which will often attempt to install itself on your system without your permission and will lock you out of old Office 2000 functionality and bug you about you owning a trial version of Office 2007 and that you need to (get this) PAY MONEY to keep using it and unlock all the features!! (features which Office 2000 already had)

If you own a hard copy of Office 2000 and you get that nasty Malware on your system, you should be able to remove it from the control panel, in the Add/Remove Programs section",-1

10053,I have been using Office 2000 since it was first released and have lost count of how many computers on which I have installed it,0
10054,"Office 2003 is pretty good, but IMHO, the more Microsoft ""improves"" Office, the more difficult it becomes to use",2
10055,"This purchase is a replacement copy for a well-worn, much-loved set",0

The answer is YES",0

10099,loving my software and putting it to good use,1
10100,Works as expected,1
10101,This software is OEM and requires you to uninstall the previous version or same version as I was replacing due to having a copy not original copy,-1

10111,It was wonderfully easy,1
10112,In a few  minutes I was clicking right along,0
10113,It couldn't have been more user  friendly,1
10114,This PC has since been updated to Windows 98 SE and then fun and  ease of use is even better,1

10121,"Win 98 second edition seems to have plugged most of the holes in  that particular dam, and I've had a lot less headaches",-1
10122,It also offers a  few new features that enable password/text memory and some other little  goodies that made the second edition a better deal,1
10123,"Between this O/S and  Microsoft Office 2000, my world has been pretty stable, and I'm breathing a  sigh of relief!",1

10135,hi win98 2nd edition is greast easier than win95 at  first my computer was hangin up but there were alot of conflicts i took it to our local computer shop now it is just as fast if not faster than win95,1
10136,Windows 98 Is a huge improvement over Win 95 and compared to what's out there it's the best,1
10137,"Linux is getting better but still not user friendly, OS/2 is dead, and the MAC OS just does not have any software so compare to  the rest it's the best",1
10138,"If you are going to install it on a server or  workstation I would recommend Windows NT, or Windows 2000, if you know what  you are doing linux",0

10141,"User friendly, has allot of support and allot of software",1
10142,"Not only is Windows 98 just an excuse for Billy to make some cash and get rid of the bugs in Windows 95, Windows 98 SE is an expensive bug fix and hard drive space eater for Windows 98",-1
10144,Microsoft Windows undoubtedly is the worst popular OS on the market,-1

10150,Why can't commercial general purpose operating systems today be as simple and reliable as Win98? I purchased an IBM ThinkPad T20 awhile ago with the intention to use it for managing my small collection of telecommunications equipment,-1
10151,"Unfortunately, this laptop had XP installed along with a bunch of other software that was slowing the system down quite significantly",-1
10152,"After nuking the T20's hard drive, I installed 98 SE with not a single problem during the installation",1
10153,"Now, after about two years of faithful service, I have not run into any problems with this OS",1

10176,I received a very good copy of Windows 98,1
10177,Windows 98 on newer machines is more  difficult to install,-1
10178,The main reason I bought it was to use older software that like this version of windows,0
10179,Microsoft hasn't been nice to older versions of software that is still usable so coming up with older versions of windows is a necessity,2
10180,The machine I am installing it on had a windows version compatible with 98,1
10181,The biggest problem has been with memory as 98 can't use the majority of it,-1
10182,The vendor was excellent,1
10183,I received my order sooner than expected,1
10184,"Dont even have to register this edition, if your not going to be online, just playing old school games, registration for this windows not needed",0

10203,I don't write a lot of bad reviews,1
10204,I am a pretty easygoing person and I rarely can't get along with a product,-1
10205,I wouldn't really say that about Windows 98,1
10206,"First, Microsoft had to release a patch that made Windows 98 shut down slower because it was issuing the power off command before some hard drives could park",-1
10207,I think this should have been fixed in the alpha stage and is pretty embarrassing,-1
10208,The next problem is that it needs a driver for EVERYTHING,-1
10209,Windows 98 supports pretty large hard disk sizes without problems in my experience,1
10210,So the question is why isn't there a decent driver library right out of the box like ANY OTHER version of Windows,0
10211,This is a big PITA because NOTHING plug and play works -- ever,-1
10212,Dell released a generic USB stack for NT 4,1
10213,0 and it works natively with any flash drive on the market with full hot swap-ability,1
10214,Games run on Windows 98 but nothing else,1
10215,Not a lot of web browsers like 98 and not a whole lot of non-MS programs like it either,-1
10216,"Almost any period specific game will -- kind of like a power drill that can only spin a desk fan: who cares?

There is no 'sweet platform'",0
10217,Windows 95 runs like a top on a 486 or a Pentium 1,1
10218,Windows NT runs like a bandit on a Pentium III,0
10219,"Windows XP runs great on an AMD Sempron, or Pentium M (everything runs like a scalded cat on a Pentium M) and Windows 7 runs perfect on a Pentium D",1
10220,Windows 98 just didn't get the freaking memo,-1
10221,I have never found a computer that 98 really agreed with -- the crappy ACPI support caused problems on AMD anything and Pentium III and later,0
10222,Pentium II and before were too slow,0
10223,Windows 98 is just the odd man out,0
10224,"The 'upgrade' Windows ME introduces a lot of cool features, but is a buggy mess",-1
10225,The best thing to do is stick with the NT series (4,0
10226,"0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8) and don't look back at the DOS versions unless you want 95 or 3",0
10227,"I was hoping for a bit more than the bare bones, but maybe that's what is added by computer vendors",-1
10228,Still for my purposes what I was sold will be adequate for my needs,0
10229,"I did have to find a flash drive driver, which this version of windows didn't have",-1

10365,"after almost an hour of hard work!), it gave me a ""Windows protection"" error, which prevented the computer from starting up",-1
10366,It took me a while to figure out how to get around that,0
10367,"2) When I installed other programs, I sometimes got error messages at the end of installation, though the programs seemed to run okay afterward",-1
10368,"3) When I run many programs simultaneously, the computer crashes easily",-1
10369,"4) About 4 out of 10 times I shut down the computer, it freezes and I have to turn it off by pressing the power button!

Thus, if your computer can support Win 2000 or XP (i",-1
10370,"if it's fast enough and the hard drive has enough space), avoid 98SE at all cost!  Not only Win 2000/XP rarely have the above problems, but some of the latest software (e",-1
10371,Microsoft Office 2003) requires at least Win 2000 and won't run on 98/98SE,-1
10372,"In addition, if I am not mistaken, only Win 2000 Service Pack 4 or Win XP Service Pack 1 or 2 can natively support hard drives bigger than 137 GB",2
10373,"Another (minor) inconvenience is that for hard drives between 64 and 137 GB, you need to get a special, free update from Microsoft if you want Windows 98/98SE to recognize the full capacity of the drive",-1
10374,"However, if you must use either Win 98 or 98SE, Win 98SE is the better choice because certain programs are supported only by the former but not the latter, e",2
10375,"Acrobat Reader 6 and Windows Media Player 9, and many USB devices I have used are supported by 98SE but not by 98",0
10376,Windows 98 is much better than Windows 95,1
10377,2000 or XP is really the way to go if you have the hardware for it,1
10378,I ordered this product on a Monday and received that week on Friday,1
10379,Shipping was on time and the shipper even sent an email to let me know he received my request for the item,1
10380,Very Good!,1
10381,Seller was very fast and efficient,1
10382,I would deal with him again,1
10383,He was exceptionally helpful with my questions regarding the product that I purchased from him,1
10384,A GREAT GUY!,1
10385,"My daughter, who's six, loves playing this game",0
10386,"Initially, she needed me to assist her, but now she's very familiar with the features on her own and can play an hour by herself",0
10387,"The characters are interesting, the races are exciting, and the hunt for clues can be initially frustrating but eventually very rewarding",0
10388,"When you find a clue and it unearths another piece of the puzzle, then my daughter gets very excited",0
10389,"The overall design of the game, and the artwork involved, are very impressive",1
10390,"The feature where Barbie occasionally calls her ""detective partner"" by name is a cool feature",1
10391,I love the scenes where she taps her toes and meditates on her clues,0
10392,Becky's crime computer is a nice feature to assist in analyzing the clues,1
10393,"Heck, we even like the music!",1
10394,I have the Barbie Detective 1: The Carnival Mystery and I LOVE it! I can't wait to get the new one: Barbie Detective 2: The Vacation Mystery,1
10395,I adore playing it! It has different clues and a different criminal everytime! It's  such a fun and enjoyable game,1
10396,"You move Barbie, gather clues, and play fun  carnival games",1
10397,"You move around the carnival trying to find Ken, who  kidnapped Ken, and the carnival money",1
10398,It's a great game and I can't wait  until I get my hands on the second one!,1
10399,"This has got to be the easiest home design software I have ever seen (and yes, I've seen a great many)!  Having NEVER used, or even seen this product before, I have managed, in less than 10 hours, to design and completely finish a very professional looking, 2-story 32' X 24' Garage/Loft Apartment",1
10400,And I never even cracked open the instruction manual,1
10401,You'd have to be a total idiot to not be able to use this software,1
10402,"The only limitation I have found (so far) is that it won't allow you to insert a door of any size into the side, support-framing of a staircase which I would have liked to have been able to do in my garage/loft project",0
10403,"It does, however, leave the end open underneath the stairs for this",0
10404,"If you're hard-to-please and expect to get more than you're paying for, this software may not be for you",2
10405,"Otherwise, I very highly recommend this software",1
10406,even to those who just want to have fun,1
10408,"for those of you who are into small scale modeling of various sorts INCLUDING model railroading (as I am), this software also allows you to print templates in both architectural scales AND Hobby scales including HO, S, G and O!
I recommend a PC with at least a 500+ MHZ processor for the 3D pan-viewing, but my 233 will handle it",2
10409,slowly,-1
10410,"I bought this software 2 weeks ago, and I have yet to get it installed in a way that makes the ""3D Furniture Workshop"" part of it functional",-1
10411,"When I launch that component (which is required in order to resize the stock furniture pieces or create new ones) it tells me the names of two DLLs that it is unable to load, even though they do exist in c:\windows and c:\windows\system, respectively",-1
10412,"Since it cannot locate these DLLs, all 3D rendering is disabled, and in fact 2D viewing also displays only a blank screen",-1
10413,"Punch's supoort e-mail takes 3 days to reply to e-mail, and the telephone support number is not open on week-ends or evening",-1
10414,"I cannot return it to the store, because I had thrown out the
package before I realized the problem",-1
10415,"Based on the information in the reviews here on Amazon, I will ask Punch for a refund",-1
10416,"After using this software for 2 nights, I realized that I could get better results using Microsoft paint",-1
10417,"Not really, but it is ridiculous that Punch can put out a product that is so limited in features and function",-1
10418,"All I wanted to do was put an entry door on a split-level, but you can only put the door on the first or second level, not in-between",-1
10419,"I really only bought the product to lay out a deck, but the deck functions are a joke",2
10420,I used a lot of these entry level design programs and this was one of the worst,-1
10421,Pad and paper are more fun than this program,-1
10422,(I never thought I would say that),0
10423,"I have a fairly high-speed NT system, and although the 3",0
10424,"51 product is advertised as being compatible with NT, it's not",0
10425,The software completely hangs up my computer every time I do a 3-D viewing,-1
10426,"Customer service was polite, but useless",2
10427,I'm glad there's a money-back warrantee!,1
10428,This is the first home planning software I've ever bought,0
10429,I found most of it difficult to use until I got accustomed to the program,-1
10430,There are some features I wish it had such as more 'undo' options and more home plans,-1
10431,I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known beforehand that it only had 20+/- of it's own house plans that you could alter,-1
10432,Several other similar programs boast 100's of home plans that you can alter to your tastes,-1
10433,"Regardless, it's a good program if you want to be able to ""build"" your home, design the interior, and landscape the outside and fairly simple to use",2
10434,At first I really liked the program,1
10435,"Some features are good such as the  drag and drop windows and doors, textures, colors, etc",1
10436,But I quickly found  limitations,-1
10437,"The program won't do dormers, although you can get a free  download that draws one puny dormer that comes with only one roof pitch",2
10438,"If  you use other than that one pitch, the dormer doesn't line up with the  house roof",-1
10439,"It won't do crawl spaces, circular stairs, and you can't  change the color or texture of cathedral ceilings, which are another story",-1
10440,I got it to draw a gable roof with a cathedral ceiling once but then it  stopped working,-1
10441,"It will only do hip roofs regularly in cathedral
The  instructions are terrible, although product support is good",2
10442,I got email  response in a couple of hours,1
10443,"Overall, I was disappointed and returned  the program",-1
10444,I am looking for something else,0
10445,"After careful consideration of all programs in this price range and of this calliber, I decided to go with this particular one because of some of the features incl  Real Model, ultimate Deck, and autoframing",1
10446,"Well, as is  generally the case when you think you maybe getting alot for your money,  you usually end up finding out they sacrficied in other areas",0
10447,I used  the product for a full intense 2 days and became quickly bored and  frustrated with it's limitations and haven't touched it since,-1
10448,"Amazing how  they can sell us anything based on the pretty pictures used in their ads: a  few of my major complaints about it were:
the furnishings were so limited  and just plain tasteless - looks like cheap pressed fiberboard furniture  out of a mobile home",-1
10449,"the textues available were just plain cheesy  looking and no pizazz at all and also very limited - all of this had to be  designed by some group lost in a 60's time warp - the cheesy siding, etc",-1
10450,"and what about a tin roof? what I wanted - nothing even close! Most of  these programs have an online library of thousands of textures, colors,  furniture, etc",-1
10451,something they left out for such a loaded package,-1
10452,"beware  of this, can be very frustrating",-1
10453,guess I had my expectations up just a  little too high for a little bit more cutting edge look - great for those  designing retro modular homes,2
10454,I plan on returning this thing,-1
10455,"Although the level is for amateur designers, it is a very good starting point for people interested in building their own home",2
10456,"The FloorPlan Trace feature permits to users to convert a scanning of a floor plan in a  traceable template, facilitating the designing tasks",1
10457,The RealModel feature  automatically creates all the components to build a real 3D scale model  (using foam paper),1
10458,"The software has also integrated a spreadsheet cost  estimator, where you could enter the unit cost of the building components  (walls, doors, windows, etc",1
10459,) to obtain an approximated total cost,1
10460,"Other  features are 3D navigation trough the house, 3D landscaping, 3D furniture  design to customize your furniture or build new models",1
10461,"The software also  has the typical features of other softwares such as a variety of: roofing,  doors, windows, stairs, floor, pathways, etc",1
10462,I'm satisfy with the product  and I would recommend it,1
10463,Drawbacks: It needs to add more designs to doors  and windows,-1
10464,"It also should have some drawing features needed for design,  i",-1
10465,"drawing reference lines, very useful for walls or objects alignment",0
10466,These lines would not be part of the design,0
10467,This program has resulted in some classic family video for our family as my daughter has been dancing with Barbie!  My five year old LOVES it,1
10468,"She changes the dancers outfits constantly, and the ""gliter"" feature  is her favorite",1
10469,"It is possible to pick more than one dancer and have them  do their own sequence in the final ""show""",1
10470,The variety of dance  moves is extensive and the music is actually pretty good (not irritating  like the Barbie boom box - for those of you who are familiar with that  product),1
10471,Only negative comment is that the final dance show is somewhat  difficult to stop if you are not interested in viewing the whole thing,-1
10472,"Overall, Great fun!",1
10473,"If your child has played Reader Rabbit and JumpStart and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay, Humongous Entertainment's Putt-Putt series (and Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam, as well) are an excellent choice",0
10474,"These titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items, navigate a number of locations, and use their problem-solving skills to help their friends and achieve larger goals",0
10475,"Along the way, kind and gentle Putt-Putt and his dog Pep will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play games as they complete the larger tasks",1
10476,"In Putt-Putt Enters the Race, the overarching goal is to collect the items needed so Putt-Putt can run in the big race, but along the way he will recycle bottles to collect money to buy his tires, visit the library to find out about an animal that needs help, etc",1
10477,"Specifics change if you start a new game, and as other reviewers have stated, you may want to play with your child a few times before they'll be able to enjoy it on their own, so each game is good for hours of fun",1
10478,This is a fine game in a great series,1
10479,We have 5 Putt-Putt titles and enjoy them all,1
10480,100% i like this software very much and also my family too,1
10481,"My daughters were 4 & 3 when we first got this game, and they still love it at ages 6 & 5",1
10482,"They could sit and play this for hours! It took Mom's help to start - but then they were off & ""racing""!! (Press the F1 key for game hints & instructions",1
10483,")

The game changes every time you play and builds memory and teaches thinking skills - but kids don't realize that they are actually learning something! It is a fun game and definately worth the money!

I enjoy ALL of the Humongous/Infogrames games--OH, so do my girls!! Ha Ha! Freddi Fish, Putt Putt, and Pajama Sam have become my girl's favorites! They beg to play almost every night!! Definately a good buy! Even up to age 8 or 9 should enjoy! (I'm 33 and I do!!) :-)

1smileycat :-)",1
10484,"My 4-year old son loves Putt-Putt!  I have to help him the first couple of times, but after that he has no trouble at all",1
10485,I like that you have to really think and remember where things are,1
10486,He doesn't realize he's learning good skills as well as having fun,1
10487,I highly recommend all the Putt-Putt games,1
10488,"I don't know why but my children adore putt putt, I brought the verson with the toy car for my daughter for her fifth birthday because she loved putt putt, Her little brother (almost 3) will not go anywhere without the toy and enjoys the game as much as she does",1
10489,"The game is well randomised and when my four children played the first time they all ended up with slightly different games, they still had to find the same four things but the number on the flag was different and the items were hidden in different places which made the game far more enjoyable",1
10490,Three of the items have two different places that they can be found in giving slightly different story lines and there is usually two or three things that must be done first in order to obtain the required item,-1
10491,You must also earn coins by recycling bottles or fetching veges and fruit from the garden maze,0
10492,"The coins enable you to buy the tyres, to go to the car wash or to get a paint job",1
10493,"My daughter invaribly ends up with a blue car (her favorite colour), my oldest has a green car and my youngest a yellow car (he does paint the car every other available colour but always leaves the paint shop with a yellow putt putt",1
10494,")
The children have a lot of fun just collecting the items and driving around cartown that the race at the end becomes an added bonus, my youngest doesnt worry abount winning he just likes to run into the ducks, the older three play till they come first",1
10495,"Just remember that this is a childs adventure game, that will help them to think and remember but is mostly just fun and every time they play the game is a little different",1
10496,This is a great product that my 4 year old son loves,1
10497,"He really likes cars, especially racing cars",1
10498,This product has a number of fun and educational activities to do before Putt Putt can enter the race,1
10499,"My son loves the race at the end, but he never rushes through the activities, because he has such a good time doing them as well",1
10500,He particularly likes having to go to the garden maze and find different fruits and veggies,1
10501,I'd highly recommend this product,1
10502,"Just like all of the other Humongous Entertainment games, and especially Putt-Putt, this game is terrificly entertaining",1
10503,"Putt-Putt, with his dog Pep, goes to enter the Cartown 500",1
10504,"First, however, he'll need some safety  and racing gear",1
10505,"Kids learn strategic thinking, mapping, memory,  emergency, basic research, and reading skills, manners, and much more in  this colorful, fun game with pit stops along the way where kids can play  racing pinball, shelf puzzle, maze, digging, and nailing",0
10506,"Hundreds of  clickpoints and songs await children as they go through this delightful  game that changes its puzzles when you restart!  If you like this game, try  Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon, Joins the Parade, Saves the Zoo, and/or Travles  Through Time",0
10507,"My 3 year old son loves Putt Putt!  He gets such a great feeling of accomplishment when he does all that he needs to do to get into the race!  I like it because the goal is not a competitive one where you have to  ""WIN"" or ""LOSE""",1
10508,It's more of a goal of getting the  tools he needs to complete a certain job,0
10509,"It keeps him occupied for about  an hour, which also gives me great opportunities to do housework,etc",1
10510,"without feeling like I'm robbing him of the chance to do something he  enjoys!  Also, it allows him to use his own creativity & problem  solving skills, because he has to figure out how to get some of the items  on the list",2
10511,"The greatest thing, though, is when he gets all the items  & then goes to the race, he runs around the house laughing & saying  ""Number 1"" because he's so proud of himeself!",1
10512,My son is 4 and loves this game,1
10513,"It's easy enough for him to navigate around, yet challenging enough to keep him entertained",1
10514,There's an awful lot to like here and a little bit not to like,2
10515,"First, it writes darn good code",1
10516,Not perfect HTML but good HTML,2
10517,That is a huge step compared to other products,0
10518,"Secondly, it's easy to use",1
10519,This is a  very intuitive product and using it just made a ton of sense to me,1
10520,It was  my first HTML generator and it worked well,1
10521,And it's an excellent value  when compared to it's competition (Dreamweaver or Front Page),1
10522,If you are  new to web development don't even consider the other options,0
10523,It's bad is  liveable but it is bad,-1
10524,"First, it crashes occasionally",-1
10525,I don't know why  but it does,0
10526,There's no consistency to it,-1
10527,"Secondly, the button generator  is clumsy and it has a JavaScript error (at least on my version)",-1
10528,"So,  everytime I went to make a button, in addition to stumbling around with it,  I could count on an error",-1
10529,"The program still ran, it just gave an error",-1
10530,"Lastly, the product doesn't look clean",-1
10531,It looks cheap and old,-1
10532,An  interface update would do wonders for it's value,0
10533,"Having said all of that  I still give this product 5 stars because it's easy, it works and it writes  clean code",1
10534,I beat my head against the wall using other products and I  never did that with this one,1
10535,It gets 5 stars for that,1
10536,"I am very computer literate and can program in several languages, but I had never programmed in html or even set up a website before",0
10537,I kind of planned on letting HoTMetal drag me through the learning process and maybe  a little trial and error too,0
10538,HotMetal was easier to figure out than I  expected and its power for more advanced applications is obvious right from  the start,1
10539,The several views from WSIWYG to source code view let you  really understand what is going on at all levels and really adds to the  learning experience,0
10540,I would recommend HoTMetal highly to anyone that is  very familiar with word processing and has a little programming experience;  any less than that and you don't need as powerful a program,1
10541,"I downloaded the 30 days trial version of this product from the Softquad web pages, and built my very first personal website using the trial version(no tutorials etc",0
10542,etc) over a weekend,0
10543,"It is a very simple and  intuitive product, yet it let's you create professional looking web pages",1
10544,"10 days before the end of the trial, I purchased the full version from  amazon",0
10545,com,0
10546,The product price at Amazon is much lower then the sale price  offered by the vendor Softquad(USD 129),1
10547,"If there is such thing as  Price/Functionality for software, Hotmetal beats the competition  (Frontpage, Dreamweaver etc",1
10548,etc,0
10549,) with a huge margin,0
10550,"The full version  comes with an improved version of WS_FTP as well as Ulead system's earlier  releases of Photoimpact, GIF editor and Photo Eplorer",0
10551,Buy and enjoy it,1
10552,"It is fun to work with the product, it makes you feel like you know what  you are doing and you are an expert in creating web pages",1
10553,"This program is awesome!  Not only do you have the option of building a webpage in the WYSIWYG format, but you can also instantly flip to the HTML code,the unique tags on view, or preview it in a browser",1
10554,"While there may  not be many books written on this program, HoTMetaL Pro is easy to use by  anyone, yet it offers the more advanced features that are commonly found in  more expensive programs",1
10555,I just felt I had to come back and post my opinion about the tutorial for HoTMetaL after I found myself stuck again in the tutorial,0
10556,All I can say is,0
10557,it seems as if the tutorial was just slapped together in a hurry and  many of the directions are not clearly expressed,-1
10558,"(don't get me wrong, the  tutorial is good, but there are parts that are vague)I have lost alot of  time just trying to figure out what the author is trying to get me to do in  the vauge parts",2
10559,"However, I feel once I get through the tutorial, I will  have unlimited potential with this well made program",0
10560,This program is just awesome,1
10561,Robust and custimizable,1
10562,"I particaly like the ""tags on"" view, which is an unique feature to HoTMeaTaL",1
10563,"I also like how it has bulit in ftp and the ""mapings"" feature so  you ""choose"" SRC and it automaticly inserts the proper code to be  releative or abs, according to how you configure it",1
10564,This product is also  considerbly cheaper to it's competitors,1
10565,"Reasons HoTMeaTaL is beater than  Front Page:
1) Front Page forces you to use abs  urls([",1
10566,]) instead of relative(html/) HoTMeataL doesn't,0
10567,This also allows you to compose and test your pages localy before you  publish them,0
10568,"2)If HoTMeataL doesn't have a feature you need, it ok,  because HoTMeataL produces readable code, so you can edit it by hand, Front  Page code is inreadable
3)HoTMeataL uses regular ftp, it doesn't require  special ""extensions"" that are well known to be an crackers  attraction",0
10569,4)HoTMeataL offers all these features and advantages at an  lower price,1
10570,I hope you find my opinion informative: Robby Robson,0
10571,Hotmetal Pro 6,0
10572,0 is the best tool I've found,1
10573,It's simple enough for the novice yet packed full of power professionals,1
10574,Hotmetal's HTML code is clean and compact,1
10575,It's built-in error checking alerts you to potential  problems and can fix common mistakes,1
10576,The ability to create and manage  complex Web projects is outstanding!,1
10577,We received this as a gift and after a somewhat rocky start (Hard to figure out what is going on and instructions are a little vague) we loved it,2
10578,Our five year old daughter plays it constantly and loves to try to  figure out how to solve the case,1
10579,"It is different every time you play, so  even if you are able to solve it (we haven't yet) it's a new game each  time",1
10580,A great game,1
10581,we are giving it as gifts to every computer kid we  know!,0
10582,CreateACard software is easy to load on your computer,1
10583,"However, my CD did not come with an Instruction Manual so I'm currently doing the trial and error system to Create my cards",0
10584,I have been using most of the CreataCards versions for some time,0
10585,This reminded me of those teaser programs that they throw in with a new printer,0
10586,It gives you a very limited feel for the program,-1
10587,If you expect to make your own cards don't expect much of a card selection,-1
10588,Most categories just give you a selection of 3 card choices,-1
10589,Spend a few more bucks and stay away from this Special Edition,-1
10590,This was a waste of money!,-1
10591,"When I purchased this program I was unsure if I would like the layout for it, but when I received it --- I LOVED IT!  My 4 year old daughter even made her daddy a Father's Day award using this program",1
10592,"I would like to  recommend it to individuals that are looking for an easy program, maybe a  first time user, or a young child to get started on",1
10593,I am also in the  process of looking for another edition of this program,1
10594,"My sister had also  purchased this version and loved it too!  I am satisfied very much with  this version, I would like to thank the makers of this cool program which  is very easy to install and to add text or just to view in different  interesting areas",1
10595,I do encourage you all to let your children try this  version of the American Greetings CreateaCard,1
10596,It's fun and easy,1
10597,There are  also some cute and colorful screensavers included,1
10598,My granddaughter loved this game,1
10599,She is 5 and played it at least a half dozen times while visiting,1
10600,She thought the game was just challenging enough for her,1
10601,Product was brand new and well packaged,1
10602,"I have not used the program yet, but I trust that it will be what I need",0
10603,"I don't always have time to ""search"" the card section for the right words",-1
10604,"This way, it will say what ""I"" want it to say every time",0
10605,"NOW DISAPPOINTED!!!  After opening the product and attempting to use it, I have found that it is NOT compatable with my opperating system!  This was a waste of my time and a few dollars",-1
10606,No wonder it was so cheap!  (Not even worth sending it back!)  Do NOT order if you have a modern computer,-1
10607,What a disappointment,-1
10608,It is just a come on to purchase more cards software,0
10609,Limited selection for sure,-1
10610,Very limited,-1
10611,I was not aware that this so call jewel edition was a fake gem,-1
10612,Special Edition of what,0
10613,Do not waste the money on this,-1
10614,Very prompt fast service,1
10615,I have used this product for years,1
10616,The instructions are user friendly,1
10617,So pleased to be able to replace one that got broken,-1
10618,Extremely disappointed in this disc-creatacard,-1
10619,I thought it would have much more variety for cards but it does not,-1
10620,You have to buy them and then the choices are not good to choose from,-1
10621,I do not even use this at all,-1
10622,Total let down,-1
10623,This is without a doubt the worst piece of software I have ever purchased,-1
10624,By the title I expected it to be an upgrade of CreateaCard gold 8,-1
10625,"I simply uninstalled it, and threw the disk in the garbage",-1
10626,I had create a card for many years,0
10627,This is the worse one ever,-1
10628,It is so limited in choice that I;ve removed it from my computer,-1
10629,Would not recommend purchasing special edition: suggest pay more and get better choices,-1
10630,Its limited choices didnot make it worth purchasing,-1
10631,It was just OK,1
10632,Not enough choices in each card category,-1
10633,Probably would not buy it again,-1
10634,I had CreataCard before and I liked the labels and calendar features,1
10635,"I thought that was what I was getting with this version of CreataCard, but I was wrong",-1
10636,"I thought of ordering CreataCard Gold, but after reading the reviews of it, I decided not to",-1
10637,I now have Vista and it doesn't ssy anything about that being compatible,-1
10638,"Dot E, Banning, CA",0
10639,This software is great,1
10640,"There's room for improvement, however",0
10641,I would like to be able to do more editing,0
10642,Thank you,1
10643,Visual Basic 6 is a very easy to learn language,1
10644,"If you have ANY knowledge of programming at all, then you will be able to pick it up in under a week",0
10645,"If you are a beginner, then this is the language for you",1
10646,"I  was writing trainers for games with this language in under 10 days, and i'm  only 14",0
10647,"DLL's written in Visual Basic instead of C++ actually run faster, much faster, especially mathematically-oriented stuff! This has been backed up by tests! VB is incredible, incredible, incredible!",1
10648,One of the easiest to learn and funest programming languages!  The  possibilites are endless with this sofware!  A definate for any programmer,1
10649,I just started programming this year in high school,0
10650,I started with Q-Basic and have since moved onto Visual Basic 6,0
10651,WOW!  The program is awesome and fun to use,1
10652,I have been saving up money to buy it and just  recently purchased it to use at home,0
10653,I would tell anyone interested in  buying it to go for it,1
10654,It is well worth the price,1
10655,I can always cook something new,0
10656,My family loves the variety,1
10657,"The search engine is so fast, and it is way easy to use",1
10658,This is the worst software I've seen,-1
10659,The interface looks like a DOS application,-1
10660,I'm sure it would have been a killer app 15 years ago but by today's standards it is very weak,2
10661,There are a lot of recipes to be sure but I can't even recommend the content,-1
10662,"When you consider there are other programs out there that have tons of food photos to go with the recipes, video clips, nutritional information, etc",0
10663,a text-based database of recipes just doesn't compare,0
10664,even if it is very large,0
10665,I browsed the Casserole category and found 40 some odd thousand casserole recipes which is great (in an overwhelming way),1
10666,"but the only way to navigate through them all was to click Next and Previous!  I guess I could see the 40 thousandth one some time next week if all I did between now and then was click the Next button 40,000 times",0
10667,I typed in some food names and searched by ingredient with similar results,0
10668,Thousands of matches found,0
10669,Next and Previous buttons to browse them all,0
10670,"???
The software does not adjust serving sizes, plan menus, analyze nutritional value, e-mail recipes, etc",-1
10671,I guess I might recommend this to someone who was looking for a long lost recipe,1
10672,"but you can search for that for free right now using a thing called ""the Internet",0
10673,"""  I can't see why anyone would recommend this software",-1
10674,But,0
10675,that's just my opinion,0
10676,I've tried some of the others like MasterCook and Cook'n,0
10677,I prefer Cook'n but I'd recommend anything other than this,-1
10678,I have owned several versions of this cookbook and all that I can say is it is one great cookbook! The publishers have added the one final ingredient that makes it above all others,1
10679,It now has an add recipe feature! If you are a cook like me you already have several great recipes,1
10680,This cookbook lets you add them to the list,1
10681,I use this on a daily basis and cannot say enough about it,1
10682,It has a wealth of meat & potatoes recipes! Also gives you the ability of telling it what ingredients you have in your cupboard and it will give you a list of possible meals to make!,1
10683,"I used a previous version of My Labels, and was quite pleased with it",1
10684,"After changing computers a few times, the old version would no longer work with WinXP, so I ""upgraded"" to the newer version",0
10685,"Here's my gripe list:

1",0
10686,"When I tried to open my old My Labels files, it kindly offered to convert them to the new format",-1
10687,How convenient! Not at all,-1
10688,"The data gets converted (duh), but the label design disappears",-1
10690,Entering data is unbelievably frustrating,-1
10691,"If you have fields that are the same, you can copy and paste, but that's it",-1
10692,"Ctrl-D is supposed to work, but it doesn't really, making you type the same things over and over",-1
10693,"Modern software is supposed to increase productivity, isn't it?

3",-1
10694,This is really a stamp selling program,0
10695,"They actually only want you to buy stamps, the software only being a hook to bring you in",-1
10697,Placement of objects is very clutsy and it's difficult to put things close together,-1
10699,Very limited creative options,-1
10700,I'll never buy this again,-1
10701,"My Labels is great if you are making address labels, shipping labels",0
10702,You can also add graphics that come with the program or use some from another program,1
10703,I recommend this software if you are just starting out,1
10704,It is fun and easy to use,1
10705,I've used this product and the Broderbund suites and have definitely been pleased with this one,1
10706,This product gives me the flexibility i want for doing design work,1
10707,I've used the program to create a model of my home -- its working fine,1
10708,"Has a topography tool, which I've used to sketch my backyard",1
10709,Even has a user support site,1
10710,My only major complaint?  The undo functionality is highly limited,-1
10711,You might accidently erase a wall thinking you can undo it -- think again,0
10712,"The box is pretty, and there seem to be many features and functions, it just HAS to be good, right? Wrong!
Just try and resize a wall",0
10713,Or move it,0
10714,It will always shrink to one grid unit less than you drew it,-1
10715,"OK, so just drag it longer",0
10716,"Oh, darn, the other wall has shrunk now! Do this a few times, and the house will end up in the wrong place",-1
10717,"Try and shift it whole, and you guessed it - the whole thing shrinks!
The only update on the website is to v3",-1
10718,"1, yet I seem to have v3",0
10719,"2 already?! Nothing in the discussion groups except a few allusions to ""walls don't always go in the right place""",0
10720,My guess is that most customers did what I did: Took it back,0
10721,"This is the ONLY piece of software I have ever returned, in more than 15 years in the IT industry",-1
10722,Punch obviously have no test programme in place,-1
10723,"If I released a piece of software with such a fundamental flaw, I would be hung, drawn, and quartered",-1
10724,Don't trust this software - the company's standards are obviously very low indeed,-1
10725,I'm really impressed,1
10726,I just poped the CD into the drive;installation came  off without a hitch,1
10727,"In half an hour I had sketched out my home's layout,  done some basic landscaping added a deck and made a quick 3D tour",1
10728,"All this  without touching the manual! Another half hour later and I had colored  walls, furnishings standard and custom",1
10729,The tools are really straight  forward,1
10730,"PC-Cillin does have it's title box show up whenever you move from one online interface to another, but it's unobtrusive and a nice reminder that your protection is there",0
10731,I had several virii [the plural of virus] enter my system through email,-1
10732,PC-Cillin cleaned almost all of them immediately,1
10733,"Those that could not be cleaned were ""quarantined"" and the program has a nice ""submit"" button that sends them to the maker, Trend",1
10734,"Trend analysizes all of the virii you sent, and emails you a ""fix"" program for those that may have corrupted your system files",1
10735,"It automatically updates while you are online, and if that bothers you, you can minimize it, and let it do its thing unseen",1
10736,Merely installing PC-Cillin does a virus scan for you,1
10737,"For those who feel they have conflicts with it and Windows startup files, you can turn off the ""Scan on startup"" function",1
10738,"It's a good value, and I have had very good support via email",1
10739,"The voice help, is a toll call though",1
10740,I've installed PC-Cillin on dozens of PCs that were running current versions of McAfee and Norton,0
10741,"In many cases, PC-Cillin found virus infections that the other two slept through",0
10742,It is not the easiest to use nor is it always trouble-free,2
10743,I've seen some system slowdowns and crashes that were always due to a conflict with some other software running in the background,-1
10744,I've seen the same with Mc&N as well,0
10745,"Bottom line is, if you can sort out some minor conflicts that MIGHT come along, this is much more thorough than Mc&N",0
10746,Trend typically updates virus definitions every couple of days,1
10747,"During the Anna Kournikova crisis, I saw three new updates IN ONE DAY!!! Norton didn't respond until at least 48 hours later",-1
10748,I wouldn't be without it,1
10749,The problems with this software and Win95c rate as one of the worst I've ever seen,-1
10750,"I experienced problems such as Windows protection errors, random rebooting and freezing on startup, fatal exception errors and the worst modem performance ever",-1
10751,"Once I uninstalled this program, every one of these problems listed disappeared",-1
10752,I emailed their support and still haven't recieved a response after two days,-1
10753,I've since had to reformat my HardDrive and install Win95c again to correct all the after effects the software produced,-1
10754,Note:  The software was installed after performing all the upgrades suggested by PC-Sillan and more,0
10755,I was debating between Norton AntiVirus Software & PC-cillan,0
10756,I should have stuck with the name brand! Everytime I get on my computer PC-Cillan comes on and interrupts me with an update,-1
10757,"If I say ""yes"" it does its download then crashes my computer! I have Windows ""98 Sec",-1
10759,"""  If I was you I would stick with the name brands",0
10760,I told them about it but heard nothing back,0
10761,"It claims to be compatible with Windows 2000 Professional, but there are some exceptions to this",0
10762,"For example, when I installed it on my machine it wasn't able to set up the proper registry permissions and so it wouldn't work until I found an article on their web site explaining what to change in the registry",-1
10763,"Also, to make things worse, it won't work correctly in any account that doesn't have superuser or higher permissions",-1
10764,This is unacceptable in my view as it leaves my users unprotected,-1
10765,"By the way, the splash screen that comes up when you start a browser can be easily disabled by going into the ""web trap"" menu",0
10766,"I can't say for sure how well it works, but from what I hear it works very well",2
10767,"I'm not positive, I'm very careful and haven't gotten a virus yet",2
10768,"However, I certainly can tell you how Godawful annoying this thing is",-1
10769,It's constantly popping up a little window about itself,-1
10770,"This window is automatically on top, and if you're in the middle of doing something",0
10773,Because PC-Cillin wanted to give you the ever-so urgent notice that it hasn't crashed and it's still running,0
10774,"Thanks for the update, PC-Cillin",1
10775,I truly care,0
10776,I've searched and found no option to turn this window off,0
10777,I'm pretty sure it's part of the protection against malicious java and directx,0
10778,"There is an option to turn off this ""welcome"" screen but guess what?  The option is only for looks",-1
10779,It doesn't really stop it from constantly being annoying,-1
10780,"On the bright side, I've heard enough success stories to be pretty sure its protection is top notch",0
10781,"If you're not too careful, or go to the types of sites that would cause a problem, this may be the program for you",0
10782,"However, personally, I'm going to look for something far less",0
10783,annoying,-1
10784,"I used to have Mcafee virus scan and would do periodic virus checks, then moved on to Norton Internet Security, and now I have finally found the best in PC-Cillin 2000",1
10785,"The big problem I had with McAfee and Norton, was NOT the protection offered, they were very well with frequent updates",0
10786,The real problem is remembering to run virus scans with McAfee (or having scheduled runs interupt my work),-1
10787,"It was even worse with Norton, which offered a lot of protection, but anytime a cookie or java applet appeared a warning would follow",-1
10788,"It became very obtrusive and annoying, as well as causing a few system crashes",-1
10789,"PC-Cillin 2000 gets five stars from me because it allows the net protection of Notron Internet Secuirty with all the virus protection of McAfee, AND you do not notice that it is even there",1
10790,"Sure when you start your web browser the PC-Cillin 2000 banner appears for 3 seconds while loading, but after that, you will not be disturbed or annoyed with interuptions",2
10791,"Installation and use, too simple to even describe, pop in the cd, follow the online instructions, and you are done",1
10792,"No scheduling or remembering to run this, it will run in the backgrounf just fine",1
10793,"Security, ease of use, no annoyances, this is the best out there",1
10794,"I don't know how many virus utilities I've used but I do know the ones that make an impression, albeit good or bad",0
10795,"PC-cillin is a no frills, no jazz virus scanner that just works",0
10796,"It doesn't carry the big Norton or  McAfee name and it won't be advertised all over the web or in magazines,  but this thing works",1
10797,VERY well too I might add,1
10798,"Once again, compare  prices and keep one thing in mind",0
10799,"am I buying virus protection software,  or virus protection software and a big name?  You make the choice and your  wallet pays the consequence",0
10800,I've been a PCCillin user for 3-4 years,0
10801,Each and every upgrade of this powerful virus protection program never ceases to amaze me,0
10802,"It compares dollar for dollar to the highly advertised virus programs such as Norton,  McAfee & Dr Solomon's",0
10803,Get upgrade information and virus update  patterns on their user friendly (Easy to Navigate) website,0
10804,Trend's user  support is second to none,-1
10805,"Big Protection! Great Price! and hey, a Catchy  Name!",1
10806,One of the best virus scans I`ve seen and used,1
10807,It`s as good or better than Mcafee and Norton,1
10808,"The web site is easer to get to and not as busy, and they have a Email right on your version and a 1 800",1
10809,# you can call,0
10810,They answered my Email right away with very good answers,1
10811,It` worth a  try!  `,1
10812,I just joined the computer world last month and my GuerrillaMarketing with Adobe PhotoDeluxe Business Edition book I purchased included the tryout version of Adove GoLive 4,0
10813,Got all pictures scanned and even played with their backgrounds for my web page,1
10814,Now I'm hooked,0
10815,Come to amazon to purchase and saw where this great product had not been rated yet,0
10816,"The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I'm so new, I don't know what is out that could be even better",-1
10817,I just know that it worked for me!,1
10818,I received the game and it wouldn't instal on ANY of the computers (Desk or laptop),-1
10819,I don't recommend this at all,-1
10820,We also had problems with the game freezing,-1
10821,"I don't know much about the systems needed and such, but this did stop working altogether (I'm guessing when we updated Windows)",-1
10822,"Great game, just a let down when you're all excited to play and it doesn't work",2
10823,"I had to return this game to the seller, who by the way was very gracious",-1
10824,She sent me prepaid postage and promptly refunded my purchase price,1
10825,"My new computer would not recognize Oregon Trail, which is unfortunate",-1
10826,This is the game that I used to play and love it,1
10827,"However, it is not compatible with Window Vista or Windows 7, You can run it using something like DOSBox",-1
10828,You can search for this and download it,1
10829,There are a few bugs with this game,-1
10830,It freezes up everytime we play it,-1
10831,"ultra-slow, poor graphics",-1
10832,only half your yolk can ever make it over even the teeniest of water crossings,0
10833,you can debate on hiring young natives to help across the water,0
10834,you will get dyptheria and dissentary (spelling?) and you will die,0
10835,"when you kill buffaloes, you can only take 20% of the meat",0
10836,that's what I remember,0
10837,This game was awesome,1
10838,It better not be on a floppy disc though,-1
10839,The product did everything I wanted and the sofrware was easy to install and user friendly! Thanks God Bless!,1
10840,"This stupid antiquated product gets lost in setup ""searching for any installed MIPS Products""  I pity anyone running Windows 7 who is foolish enough to waste (however small an amount) money on this product!",-1
10842,Works will with early and xp version of ms software,1
10843,Can not advise for new vista,-1
10844,This product was created before Windows XP and was designed to be used with Windows 3,0
10845,"1, 95 and 98 - how many years since Windows 3",0
10846,1 was in use?  It will not run of my XP machine,0
10847,Seller does not tell you how old this software is,0
10848,"I have used Storybook Weaver with first, third, and fourth graders and have found it flexible, interesting and inspiring",1
10849,"The ease of creating pictures makes it ideal for beginning writers, and the format options allows advanced writers to produce more detailed and complex compositions",1
10850,"It's an effective way to both finish a final draft, as well as begin a story with a picture based prewriting exercise",1
10851,Kids of all ages will find the varied and imaginative picture possibilites fun,1
10852,Highly recommended for children reluctant to write and for those who can't seem to write enough,1
10853,"I bought this program thinking it would be hokey, at best",1
10854,But I was pleasantly surprised,0
10855,"My son was able to read stories or create new ones, using story starters or a 'blank sheet of paper",1
10856,"'  There are a number of  backgrounds, props, and musical themes",0
10857,You can even print out what you've  created,0
10858,He still has fun with this two years later,1
10859,"I was sorry to see  that it is out of stock, because I think this program is wonderful for  aspiring young writers",2
10860,"I want to give this product 5 stars for approach, and 1 star for scope and fair product representation",1
10861,Please read the entire review,0
10862,This is probably the best approach I've encountered for language instruction,1
10863,The organization of material is quite clever,1
10864,"After you learn a set of related words, these words are then used as reference points to help you learn the next set of words",0
10865,The process is quite enjoyable and amazingly effective,1
10866,You start with the most basic types of words,0
10867,"boy/girl/man/woman, primary colors, shapes, types of clothing, etc",0
10868,", expressed as simple phrases",1
10869,You then work up to some full sentences,0
10871,"Here's the catch: The ""Explorer"" CD only contains the first 2 lessons from the company's 8-lesson Spanish Level I package (which you would have to buy separately)",0
10872,"To complete the company's full Spanish program (and to reach material necessary for meaningful adult conversation), you would also need to buy the 8-lesson Level II package",0
10873,"If you decided to buy the entire 16-lesson ""real"" offering from the company's own web site, you would have to pay more per lesson than the Amazon price for this 2-lesson ""loss-leader"" product",0
10874,The Amazon review and product description are quite misleading,-1
10875,"Through this purchase, alone, you will only be able to learn a subset of a 4-year-old's vocabulary and grammar",-1
10876,"I bought this program for my 7-year-old neice and opened it up to ""try it out""",0
10877,"Well, I enjoyed it so much that I kept it myself and had to buy my neice another copy",1
10878,The use of photographs and the spoken  word make it easy and enjoyable to learn,1
10879,"Some people may be intimidated by  the thought of a ""total immersion"" approach to language learning",0
10880,But this program is not intimidating at all,1
10881,It is engaging and fun,1
10882,It  feels like you are playing a game (and learning at the same time),1
10883,It has  inspired me to enroll in a local Spanish class,1
10884,I also plan to purchase the  entire Rosetta Stone Spanish series,1
10885,(This program covers lessons 1-22  only,-1
10886,) You won't regret buying this program for your child (or yourself)!,1
10887,"Though I've bought many things from Amazon, I've never been moved to write a review",0
10888,Until now,0
10889,This product is wonderful,1
10890,"I'm using it in conjunction with a Spanish class at my local community college, but it  would work equally well as a stand alone way to start learning Spanish",1
10891,"You practice all skills:  reading, writing, speaking, listening, but this  program makes it feel like a game",1
10892,The Rosetta Stone is like having a  built-in study partner available at your beckon call,0
10893,Studying has never  been so much fun,1
10894,I bought this program for my 8 year old son who will start Spanish next year in school,0
10895,I am so pleased with the content and presentation of this software,1
10896,There are bright vivid pictures that correspond to the words and  phrases that are being taught,0
10897,There are several methods provided for  learning each lesson,0
10898,"The user has the options to hear the word(s)  verbally, verbally with text, etc",0
10899,I LOVE the recording feature where the  user's voice/speech is analyzed and graded for pronounciation,1
10900,"Another  fun addition to this program is the option to try other languages such as  Chinese, Latin, French, etc",1
10901,"I ordered books, tapes, and cd's to teach my  son",0
10902,This was the best product by far,1
10903,The greatest thing since sliced bread resliced my hard drive to perfection! All my partitions are FAT 32 under Windows 98,0
10904,"Yes, I've used FDISK before to do repartitioning and, believe me, it feels so much better  when you don't have to hope and pray that you backed up everything  correctly on your old partition",1
10905,"(I still back up old partitions, of  course, but now I'm not anywhere near as nervous as I was before",0
10906,) I was  particularly in need of partitioning because I didn't leave enough temp  space on my C: drive,0
10907,It's especially nice to have PartitionMagic around  when you've first unpacked a new hard drive and don't know if you've  partitioned the disk into useful enough portions,1
10908,This is truly a  must-have!,1
10909,"I will never prefer something like this over FDISK (call me old fashioned), but this is the best there is as far as partitioning on the fly",0
10910,"As a matter of fact, although FDISK is all I would ever use,  Partition Magic is what was used to partition my very first hard drive and  that partition table remained intact for over a year before I finally redid  it all",1
10911,"I did begin to have cluster problems towards the end of that  partitioning campaign, but any partition table may develop problems over  that time",-1
10912,Could be due to hardware as well,0
10913,"As far as  ""on-the-fly"" partitioning goes, look no further",0
10914,This seems  perfectly safe for creating new extended partitions without damaging or  losing data but I will never condone this practice,1
10915,I've lost data once  (not related to this) and I'll never take another chance again,-1
10916,I'm not  going to get into any specifics with this product and make it look like a  tech review because most of you just want to know if it works good or  not,0
10917,"so in short, yeh it does",0
10918,Nothing to date worth that 5 stars though!,1
10919,"In my experience (3 PCs, Win 98) this is the best software I've encountered to date",1
10920,"Intuitive, with excellent wizards, a good manual, and friendly technical help--if you have a bad HD like I did",1
10921,I would never  have attempted multiple partitions without this product,0
10922,PowerQuest has a  real winner here,1
10923,Real worth buying,1
10924,I had a problem with an old partition,-1
10925,Something must have got corrupted and I could not delete use the partition with any windows OS,-1
10926,"I tried fdisk, WIN NT utility and I just could not use the  partition",-1
10927,"With partition magic, I managed to delete it and to extend the  other partition on my disk which I was trying to do",1
10928,It is also useful if  you are running several OS,1
10929,I installed Linux recently,0
10930,I was using lilo  boot to choose between OSes,0
10931,It worked fine but a few months later I had  to reinstall Windows and of course LILO was gone,-1
10932,Windows does not  tolerate very much other OSes,-1
10933,"It is really worth to get Partition Magic,  despite the $50",1
10934,I use it to divide my 13Gb hard disk into three with two OS - Windows 98 and Red Hat Linux 6,0
10935,"Until now, I do not face any problems relating to this product",1
10936,My computer is still running smooth,1
10937,"I would think that this  product is good, at least I would not need to reformat my hard disk and  remain my valuable data",1
10938,"However, I think it is a little bit expensive",-1
10939,I received an email message from PowerQuest that Windows 2000 support will be available for Partition Magic 5,0
10940,0 as a free patch in April or May,0
10941,Check their website periodically,0
10942,This addresses the concerns of one of  the reviewers,0
10943,I now plan to purchase this product,1
10944,The computer staff at  Rutgers Chemistry Department rates this product as exceptional,1
10946,"Finally, a software product that does exactly what it claims to do",1
10947,and it does it perfectly,1
10948,I dreaded partioning the 27 Gig hard drive on my new Dell,0
10949,"If I'd only known how easy Partition Magic would make it, I never  would've sweated it out",1
10950,Perfect!,1
10951,It is unable to expand a NT NTFS drive,-1
10952,It does not support Windows 2000,-1
10953,"Unless you are using a 'toy' operating system like Win98, don't waste your money like I did",-1
10954,This (to me anyway) is one of those things that you never really think about buying,-1
10955,"Then one day, you realize that you have tons of disk space, and documents littered all over the place",0
10956,"That was my experience, anyhow",0
10957,"So, you go and buy PartitionMagic",0
10959,"Don't bother looking  anywhere else, nothing can really touch this",0
10960,It makes partitioning as  easy as it can probably be,1
10961,"I had a drive that was a real mess,  partitioned with Linux, FAT file system, and all over the place",0
10962,PartitionMagic cleaned up that drive in minutes,1
10963,"It does take quite a  while for some operations to complete (but we're talking gigabytes of  data), I set it going and went for lunch",2
10964,"I like the other tools in the  package - BootMagic does its job admirably (and, IMHO, is much better than  LILO), and MagicMover (moves applications/folders across partitions)  appears to do its job adequately - this one really takes a while",0
10965,"There's  nothing out there that can really touch this, and if you have either (a) 1  very large drive, (b) two or more drives or (c) multiple OSs, then this is  for you",1
10966,This is one of those rare gems of a product whose advertising does not pay due diligence to it's unbelievable quality and reliability,1
10967,"Yes, it is really that good and no I don't work for PowerQuest",1
10968,"At some point you will need to resize a partition, make a new partition, or clone a drive and PM  makes it easy and worry-free",1
10969,"If you think you might need this, just buy  it",0
10970,It's worth it,1
10973,Also be forewarned that if you buy that new huge drive you still might not  be able to partition it how you want,-1
10974,Example: the BIOS in my PC (at least  I think that's what to blame) cannot access drives > 8gb so my 13 gig  drive is painfully data free,2
10976,"btw, you can often find this product on  sale in computer stores",0
10977,My 3-year-old son would spend hours at his computer playing with this software if we allowed it,0
10978,He creates whole stories with the various elements this software brings together,0
10979,He loves to dress up the characters and put them in cinematic situations,1
10980,He eagerly points out all the details to his setups once he's finished an image,0
10981,"It's an absorbing, imagination-stretching bit of technology that we're glad to have in our house",1
10982,On time and wonderful,1
10983,What more can you ask for?  Kasia loves it,1
10984,I think my son got this when he was 3 years old,0
10985,"He is now 8 years old and we have added two girls to the family, 5 and 3 years old",0
10986,They all love this game,1
10987,My 3 year old can play it with no problem,1
10988,"And now my son is really a little too old for Elmo, however when the girls are done playing it I have seen him sneak over play it for a while",0
10989,Well got our money's worth!!,1
10990,This has been a great game for my 3 year old daughter--she loves to draw and color and this game seems to tickle her creative interests,1
10991,"It has been an exceptional, inexpensive purchase and one she can play over and over with new challenges",1
10992,I guess I'm writing this review because we have purchased some duds and it is always nice to see a ringing endorsement of something that really works!  Hope this helps you,0
10993,"Of all the software, our five-year old likes this program the best",1
10994,It's 'user friendly' and can entertain for a long period of time,1
10995,"Projects  include Stickers (where the child can complete a picture using point and  click), Costumes (dress up characters  in outfits and outrageous  accessories), and Coloring Book scenes with an 'automatic fill' feature",0
10996,"These can be painted or colored, rubber stamped, or personalized and can be  printed out",0
10997,Hours of fun,1
10998,Wonderful graphics,1
10999,"The sticker pages include  scenes for both boys and girls: outer space, picnics, birthday parties,  snow scenes, beach, etc",0
11000,I highly recommend this software,1
11001,Sesame Street Art Workshop (SSAW)is one of the best loved CD-ROMs in our collection,1
11002,SSAW enhances a child's artistic ability by having activities a mouse click away that would otherwise be limited by the child's fine  motor coordination,0
11003,"The strengths of the program are that it is easy to use  by a pre-reading child and offers numerous activities including coloring,  stamping, and free drawing",1
11004,Some of the more clever pages include finger  puppets and birthday cards,1
11005,"The weakness of the program is that it does  not allow color mixing as, for example, the Madeleine Classroom Companion  does",-1
11006,This is a great starter program for ages 2 on up and one you will  not regret buying,1
11007,"Ok, ere' goes",0
11008,I purchased this game about a month ago,0
11009,"Please take notice, The above mentioned so called WHIZKID is not so whiz",-1
11010,"Afterall, he does have a terribly insulting, sulking attitude about absolutely  everhting",-1
11011,Maybe he wanted a hug when he was a kid,0
11012,'Shame to see so many  depressed people,-1
11013,"ANYWAY, this game needs alot more credit than it's  been given",1
11014,It is a very charming and time consuming game,2
11015,"It is  unfortunately, rather frustrating if you come across some rather difficult  norns",-1
11016,"Which, might I include, does not, very fortunately, happen very  often",0
11017,Only when the norn is mistreated,0
11018,"That's right, mistreated, they  actually recognize when they're not being treated well",0
11019,"Unless you  have absolutly no skill with toddlers, or young children, who, obviously  would need alittle love and care, this game is very rewarding",1
11020,"Unless you  are one of the people described in the above sentence, like the Unknown  Whizkid, who so graciously decided to be malicoius and unreasonable,you'll  absolutley adore this game",2
11021,It's very sweet,1
11022,"You watch the young ones  grow up, and become adults, then they have children of their own",0
11023,"The  children are too adorable for words, they pay attention to the all powerful  hand untill they reach adolescence, something that most teenagers do",1
11024,"I  should know, I am one",0
11025,But they still depend on you to look out for them,0
11026,"Unless your coldhearted and don't have enough patience to care for a child,  then I highly recommend this game",2
11027,It's actually more of a learning  expieriance,1
11028,"If you intend to babysit, or if you already do, than this is  good practice",1
11029,"The norns actually look qiute alot like gremlins, If you've  ever seen the movie",0
11030,"I hope that you decide to purchase this game, or the  third version, because the creatures in the first game are repulsive and  disgusting, have no facial expression, and they blend into the background",-1
11031,The graphics are absolutley terrible in Creatures 1,-1
11032,I suggest you stay  away from that edition,-1
11033,"Good luck with the game, I hope you enjoy it!",1
11034,"Some of the other Reviews for Creatures 2 aren't so good, and I relize This, but once you get into it and you start to like the idea of saving the ecosystem, AND SOME REALLY CUTE NORNS from complete destruction,then you  begin to understand your Norns, Grendels and Ettins",0
11035,It's not as hard as  people say,1
11036,They're all close minded,-1
11037,"this is a really challenging game,  and I'll admit to that, but the norns do obey you, they do seem real, and  they do listen to your commands, even if your not an animal tamer, and you  can save Albia, Even if your not an expert bioligist",0
11038,It's not as hard as  people make it out to be,1
11039,"And the norns really are sweet things, I'll  admit they aren't as cute and cuddly as the first Creatures adventure, but  they are cute",0
11040,"I think that people just need to relax and try to understand  the meaning of this game, which is really easy to do, I really like it",1
11041,People just need to have an open opinion on some of these things,0
11042,"If you  want my advice, this is a really interesting game, it makes you think,  there are gene splicers to create your own norns, and ettins,and all types  of neat adventures ready for you as you explore a computer world complete  within itself, and virtualy perfect except for the Grendels",1
11043,"(  YUUCCCKKKK! )This Truly is a great game, a work of 3D art, but if your  not ready to give these creatures your full dedication and time, then this  isn't the game for you, although it is fun",2
11044,"Have fun and play great, I hope  kids of all ages can appreciate this wonderful game, but I don't recomend  this game for anyone under 10 (It WILL be to hard for them! )have fun!",2
11045,"At the risk of large numbers of Creatures fans mobbing me at my bus, I have to say that I didn't like this game at all",-1
11046,"I was a minor Creatures 1 fan, and I rushed out and bought Creatures 2 the first day it was available",0
11047,"Yes, I risked looking like a dork among dorks in the computer  store's kiddie section (obviously the game was mislabeled), but I got it  anyway",0
11048,What a mistake,-1
11049,The first thing I noticed wrong was that it was  hard,1
11050,"You might think, ""Well, great!  I can't wait to try it!""  No, it's not a good kind of hard",0
11051,It's really **really** hard,-1
11052,"If you're  not a biologist, don't expect to give your Creatures injections that will  actually do what you want to do (well, unless you **want** to kill your  Creatures",0
11053,")  And, unless you're an animal trainer, don't expect to be  able to get your Creatures to be able to talk, to come to you, or even to  marginally like you",0
11054,Second problem: ugly Creatures,-1
11055,"The last game, they  were cute",1
11056,"Now, they look like little monsters from a B-rated movie",-1
11058,Third and final problem: just not the way you'd want to spend your  Saturday,-1
11059,You get enough of it from your coworkers and kids; do you REALLY  want to deal with it on your computer?,0
11060,I used to be addicted to playing Dr,0
11061,Brain on my Windows 95 computer back in 1995,0
11062,"Years later, the game got lost and computers got upgraded",0
11063,"Just recently, I was talking with my sisters about how great this game was and how much we would like to play it again",1
11064,"I learned so much and exercised my brain so much when I was a kid, that I really wanted to try it now as an adult",1
11065,I found it here on Amazon and bought it,1
11066,I had to install a Virtual PC (with Windows XP) on my Windows 7 64-bits laptop because the game is not compatible with it,-1
11067,It worked well and I was very thrilled to try Dr,1
11069,"This was an excellent game at the time, but I've found that I've been unable to play this game on any modern operating system or on Windows 98 in a Virtual Machine",2
11070,"I had this game when I was younger and I thank my lucky stars that my parents bought it for me!  I can name all of the elements on the periodic table by their symbols, and sight-read music a little bit",0
11071,"This game provides children with skills they won't realize the utility of for a few years, but it put me way ahead in my high school chemistry and AP Psychology classes!!",1
11072,This puzzle game truly bends your mind,1
11073,"Each puzzle is challenging, even on the easy level",1
11074,Three levels of play would even give those at Mensa a difficult time,0
11075,The three dimensional work has helped me picture things for my geometry homework more easily,1
11076,"Although the game does not actually focus on parts of the brain, it focuses on all aspects of logic and reasoning skills",2
11077,Definently worth buying for all young puzzl solvers,1
11078,I am really surprised at all the positive reviews of this software,1
11079,"Have any of the other reviewers used anything else, like Dreamweaver or GoLive?
FrontPage is the bottom of the barrel, folks, and the problems are numerious:
- You can't edit source code in a way that sticks",-1
11080,"FrontPage sometimes create bad HTML, and you're stuck with it",-1
11081,#NAME?,2
11082,"FP  makes few allowances for Netscape, Opera, etc",-1
11083,#NAME?,1
11084,"I could go on, but I strongly suggest you shop around",0
11085,"This software is wonderful for those individuals looking to put together a quick, adequate site without any programming",1
11086,"Bear in mind, however, that some functionality, such as Java Script, is often difficult",-1
11087,"Also, to  utilize such features as search, feedback forms, etc",0
11088,", you will need to  find a server that supports FrontPage Extensions",0
11089,"I have mastered the  program, but find it exteremely powerful for someone not all that  interested in being bogged down with html code",2
11090,This is the VERY best HTML editor I have used,1
11091,"It's over the HTML editor of Net Objects, and it's easy, VERY easy use it",1
11092,"What You See Is What You Get with this program, so the final result of your work is what you see  while you work on it",1
11093,I think it's great,1
11094,You must not know about HTML,0
11095,"And  if you like make web sites, and you work with a server with FrontPage  extensions, you will enjoy VERY, VERY much do your sites with this program",1
11096,The best of the best HTML editors,1
11097,I have been using FrontPage for about 2 years and 2000 is great,0
11098,"It neatly organizes my pages, the wizards are useful and has many features that automates tedious tasks",1
11099,"Also, alot of online hosting sites now offer  FrontPage extentions",0
11100,Something I did not have when I first started :),0
11101,Frontpage 2000 is a great program that allows beginners to advanced web designers to have awesome websites,1
11102,The program's features are very flexible and allow you to edit in both WYSIWYG (What you see is what you  get) mode and Raw HTML mode,1
11103,"It will make frames for you automatically, a  feature that many webmasters want but are not sure how to create, and much  more",1
11104,"This is a wonderful, powerful program that I definitely recommend  buying if you have the money",1
11105,Received quickly and in great working order,1
11106,Can't live without Image Composer and was thrilled to find it at a great price!,1
11107,Couldn't find my disk when I had to reformat so purchased this one through Amazon,0
11108,Makes setting up web pages very easy and I like the fact you can see what the finished page will look like or change it to html view if you want to manually add anything,1
11109,FP 2000 is probably the best html editor Microsoft developed,1
11110,"Of course, that is my opinion, but its versatility suits my needs",1
11111,I rate FP 2000 as great,1
11112,Thanks Amazon for providing a copy,1
11115,"When my laptop OS messed up, I had to format and reload OS and programs",0
11116,"I was unable to locate my old FP2000 installation disk, so needed to order a replacement",0
11117,This item fit my needs exactly,1
11118,"The company has some computer issues of their own, and I did not receive my order as timely as I expected; however the company was responsive to my inquire, shipped my ordered product, and waived the expedited shipping charge",2
11119,"Stuff happens, and I would order from them again",1
11120,Purchased this product for the MS Image Composer Ver,0
11121,"5 that
was included",0
11122,That product is being utilitized by a friend to maintain several websites he developed over the past ten years,0
11123,"It's extremely easy to use if you're looking to create very simple sites, but I'm still getting to know the program",2
11124,"I've always built sites strictly with code, and I thought this could expedite some work, but the learning curve is taking a little longer than anticipated",-1
11125,I bought this item and then found the one it was replacing,-1
11126,I emailed the seller and they returned my money,1
11127,Very good communication and very HONEST seller,1
11128,"For some time I've been looking for software for Microsoft's FrontPage, as I'd used a component -- Image Composer -- for years, and lost it when my old computer died",0
11129,"Finally, I tried Amazon's resources and VOILA! I found it!  The source delivered as promised",1
11130,new and in the box reinforcing my previous experience with Amazon's vendors,0
11131,"excellent product for developing web pages, I don't know why MS discontinued it, but I love being able to flip between the html code, a graphical editor and an actual view of what the page will look like on screen",1
11132,it's simple to use,1
11133,I was very pleased with the order processing and delivery,1
11134,The product was exactly what they promoted,1
11135,Microsoft FrontPage 2000 is a fantastic webpage creator/HTML editor,1
11136,"Before purchasing my copy of FrontPage 2000, I was using Adobe GoLive 5",0
11137,What I especially liked about FrontPage 2000 was the ease of use,1
11138,"If you have ever used a Microsoft Office product before, you can learn FrontPage with relative ease",1
11139,"FrontPage brings templates (such as online forms) to you, which other products do not",1
11140,"There is a downside for FrontPage, and that is for some of the more advanced features the host server will need to have FrontPage extensions installed on it",-1
11141,You should check this with your host before purchasing,0
11142,"This is becoming less of a problem, however, because more and more hosts are installing these extensions",0
11143,"If you don't mind moving your site, you could always move it to a host with these extensions anyway",0
11144,"This is one product, I would highly recommend",1
11145,I have had some pretty stinkers for web programs when I just started out,1
11146,So I really wished I had gotten this first,1
11147,When I got it I was really impressed how easy it was to learn,1
11148,"It was hard a little at first, but once I got the hang of using it I loved it",1
11149,I have made a few great sites with it,1
11150,My friend even designed a site for me and with my Frontpage program I was able to edit with Microsoft Frontpage to keep updating the site,1
11151,And now it's one of my best sites! So I would definately get Frontpage 2000 if your just starting out or again if your a professional web designer :),1
11152,Microsoft makes some great technologies for the web,1
11153,But Frontpage is a product aimed for the home user that should not have any place in professional web development,0
11154,Frontpage extensions(a server side technology that does things like process forms) doens't work well when it does work and can be a pain to administer,-1
11155,Frontpage writes much IE specific code and will automatically put in features that only Frontpage will support,0
11156,"Microsoft has some great server side technologies such as ASP,SQL Server, and IIS",0
11157,"but for an editor don't use Frontpage, look into something more professional such as Dreamweaver",0
11158,Untill now i couldn't find web publishing program that give you clean html code,0
11159,I used frontpage 98 for more than 1 year and i found it better than others like Dreamweaver,1
11160,It has the same interface for all microsoft application which saves your time to understand each icon and its funtion,1
11161,When i tried frontpage 2000 i like its interface more but i don't think there is a big differences between it and the old version 98,2
11162,With all frontpage (98 and 2000) you need to know a bit about HTML in order to make clean-coded pages with less bugs,0
11163,"I like the  integration between Office software with frontpage 2000 , in which you can easily publish information stored in an Access database or Excel spreadsheet",1
11164,"I hope Microsoft will improve  manipulation with tables, because i really need to check the HTML code to organize any table i did in frontpage",-1
11165,"Another thing, for arab users, you can not highlight the right arabic text in frontpage 2000 editor i",-1
11166,"e if u try to highlight any word the editor will higlight another word!!! which is very annoying thing (you should use the HTML code to manipulate any word!!) So, Stick with your frontpage 98 if you want to design arabic pages",-1
11167,Microsoft Front Page 2000 is great for anyone just beginning to design personal web pages,1
11168,"It is also practical for more advanced use as well, but I feel it is better suited for smaller website design projects",2
11169,"It is very easy to cut, paste, arrange, and redesign existing web pages with FrontPage",1
11170,"FrontPage will allow even the newest beginner to website design to put together exciting web pages without even knowing how to use HTML code, although a basic knowledge of the HTML language would be helpful and can be learned through trial and error use with FrontPage",1
11171,"(Note: For anyone looking for the most up to date version of FrontPage, FrontPage 2002 is due out from Microsoft later this year",0
11172,"Hi, Whoever says, Site designed with Frontpage will not show perfect in Netscape are not knowing FrontPage 2000 completely",0
11173,Frontpage 2000 has settings for Browsers as well as servers,0
11174,"If you set these options, the you will not have single item on your site which will not show perfectly in Netscape",0
11175,Front Page 2000 is a product for 90% of the peoples' requirement,0
11176,"If you have any question on Front Page 2000, you may ask me at hasitdave@yahoo",0
11177,com Hasit Dave,0
11178,"I tried several webpage packages (notably HotMetal Pro) and I have to say, FrontPage is by far the easiest, most intuitive and powerful software in its class",1
11179,In no time I had a webpage up and running,1
11180,"Maintaining it is easy, too",1
11181,Setting up the navigation scheme is simple,1
11182,"There are nice art themes included, and they aren't hard to modify, either",2
11183,So you can get an attractive webpage published very quickly with FrontPage,1
11184,It has some quirks,1
11185,"Netscape, forget it",-1
11186,And some of the free webpage hosting sites have trouble with FrontPage's web publishing protocol,-1
11187,This means you have to upload the pages one by one with FTP (file transfer protocol,0
11188,) And  you may not be able to some of the features of the themes like CSS,0
11189,"This doesn't bother me a lot, as it is really more a problem of the hosting site, not FrontPage",0
11190,"The package also allows easy use of ActiveX controls, plug-ins, and Java applets, and normal scripting for fancy stuff on graphics-heavy webpages (careful, as these slow down loading time for many visitors",1
11191,Know your audience,0
11192,")  If you are going to get heavily into scripts, ActiveX, plug-ins and more, including Flash, better to go into something like Dreamweaver, where you get more control over what goes into the HTML coding",0
11193,"If you want more than a casual homepage as can be designed by such hosting providers as Geocities, this is definitely the package to use",0
11194,"It's fun, too",1
11195,(When was the last time you could say that about a software package other than a game?),0
11196,"Yes, Frontpage is a decent program, and I don't want to rehash the good points that the other reviewers have pointed out",1
11197,My general belief is that in a side-by-side comparison with the other 2 design products I have used is that Frontpage loses more than it wins,-1
11198,Problems:  Be sure to check out the designed pages in a Netscape browser,-1
11199,Any complicated page will require a refit for both the 4,-1
11202,Javascript?  Major differences also create problems,0
11203,Ever gone to a site in Netscape only to have it look wierd?  Probably designed in Frontpage,0
11204,"Of course, if you want to dismiss the 30% of your customers who still use Netscape, go right ahead",0
11205,The interface is not intuitive,-1
11206,"Microsoft did a great job with Excel and Word, making it easy to use for beginners but feature-rich for experienced users",2
11207,"Count on a long learning curve on this baby, even if you are a skilled designer",-1
11208,Finally: The templates are great,1
11209,"However, Frontpage is extremely popular and the templates are overused, so you run the risk of seeing a similar site (or many similar sites)",2
11210,My recommendation:  Design with template then change all the MS images,0
11212,Of course maintaining all the stuff for a growing website(s) from within Frontpage is a main feature,0
11213,And it does a whole lot of things,0
11214,I've used the program for a while now,0
11215,The main disadvantage is a non robust way of program execution,-1
11216,"The filehandling is all but clear, the updates for file incorporation is painfully slow and that on a 2 processor PIII 500 MHz workstation running windows 2000",-1
11217,"The loading of all graphical components, wether belonging to the programs userinterface or otherwise, is slow",-1
11218,The programmatic features is hard to reach in many levels of clicking,-1
11219,"The hard to get insertion facility: to get at the graphical point you want, is akward, inexact from a user intervention point of view",-1
11220,"The crippled text areas, where you do not see entire file path, are not consequently performed through the software, THIS IS A NOVICE DESIGN ERROR",-1
11221,The navigation structure takes sometimes over 20 seconds to load in for a small number of pages,-1
11222,After closing or working with a web the Folder list is not clickable to go away,-1
11223,This isn't a novice program,-1
11224,It isn't Professional,-1
11225,It reach between novice and professional,0
11226,"Although it works nicely with microsoft specific features, not all features are accessible from within the editor per se",-1
11227,"Please note that Microsoft FrontPage 2000 *requires* registration, at least my copy did",0
11228,It will stop working if you don't register,0
11229,"Some users may not find this bothersome, but it means whenever you install the product you must get a registration key of some kind from Microsoft",0
11230,"As a professional web designer who spends countless hours using different programs, YES I DO WORK IN DREAMWEAVER, I find that the Microsoft Front Page 2000 has gotten a bad rap",-1
11231,A lot of my professional collegues scoff at the idea that a professional designer uses Dreamweaver,0
11232,"They say Front Page is not a real program, it's for hack web designers",0
11233,What most of these designers are missing is the true point of MS Front Page 2000,0
11234,It is designed for the average joe to come in and be able to design and maintain a simple site with out a huge learning curve,0
11235,The interface is very familiar to any Microsoft Office user and they don't have to spend a lot of time learning the meaning and locations of new buttons and tools,1
11236,My Company AffordableNetSolutions,0
11237,com has become a great sucess by designing complex web design and graphics and then empowering our customers to use MS Front Page 2000 to edit and maintain their own sites,0
11238,"It is easy to add/change photos, edit text and create new pages based upon an exising model",1
11239,Our customers are thrilled with our service and the fact that they don't have to pay an expensive web designer to make simple changes to their web site,0
11240,I beleive that so many web designers who complain that MS Front Page is a loser program are failing to realizing the benefits that this software can provide for the customers,2
11241,"Sure, from a professional web designer standpoint Dreamweaver is more functional to do layout design and such",0
11242,"But, it's interface is very intimidating to a newbie",1
11243,"Also, a lot of features of Dreamweaver require you to have some knowledge of programming",0
11244,"Microsoft Front Page 2000 on the other hand is less expensive, easier to use, and no programming is required",1
11245,People who don't have a lot of time and money to spare will find this to be a useful program,1
11246,There are plenty of reviews so I'll try to tell you something from the point of view of a non-programmer/home user who wanted an easy to use program to run a basic web page,0
11247,"Specifically, I wanted to be able to change a page and have the program automatically update links in every other page",0
11248,I also wanted to be able to change hosts without updating every link piece by piece,0
11249,"The problem is, the way I understand it, that it only does this if you are using a web site host that uses FrontPage ""extensions""",0
11250,They are not as common as Microsoft would like you to think they are and often cost more,-1
11251,Another case of Microsoft trying to dominate (and control) yet another aspect of the web,0
11252,"Even for basic web design, the WYSIWYG feature is very nice and the program is easy to use, but you pay for it",2
11253,"Also, I expected to be able to anchor a picture anywhere on a page but I still don't think that's possible",0
11254,"They could easily add some more capability (easy link updates) for the low end user who doesn't use their ""extensions"" and doesn't mind spending the extra money for the program",0
11255,"If you know absolutely nothing about creating a Web page, Front Page is actually too complicated for you",-1
11256,"That is, if very basic things like ""navigation bars"" and ""banners"" are not part of your vocabulary",0
11257,"It's like taking a foreign language: Although Intermediate Hebrew is much simpler than Advanced Hebrew, it still assumes you know the Hebrew alphabet",0
11258,"So, if you haven't yet tackled basic Web principles, go buy Publisher 2000 first, and use its Wizard",0
11259,That's the best tutorial,1
11260,"But if you are ready to move to the next level and want a site that demonstrates more stability and consistency than a site created in Publisher can give you, then you should consider Front Page 2000",1
11261,"You do indeed need a manual, combined with calling Microsoft's tech support line during your initial free support period (ie, once you start working, finish your project, so you can use tech support for the duration)",0
11262,A noticeable flaw in Microsoft's generally decent interface between its various software packages: You cannot import your Publisher Web site into Front Page,-1
11263,They do need to fix this glitch,-1
11264,"Nor can you import Publisher ""themes"" into Front Page, and the themes in the two packages are not at all similar",-1
11265,But do be sure to ask about your discount on Front Page when you buy it (because you owned Publisher),0
11266,"I would recommend doing your ""intermediate level"" Web site in Front Page using their 'canned' themes, then tinkering with it as you learn more about design",0
11267,"For example, you will want to customize their themes or abandon them completely, creating your own, in order to preserve your individuality",0
11268,Fix those kind of design issues later,0
11269,Concentrate first on learning the new material,0
11270,Then you can start downloading new buttons etc,0
11271,"Front Page does not handle JPEGs well as thumbnails, nor smaller versions of photographs, even if you do all the edit work you're supposed to",-1
11272,"However, the large versions, once someone has clicked on a thumbnail, are quite good and do not lose clarity",1
11273,"Additionally, the photographic clip art in Microsoft's online clip art gallery (that you can download free) works well, and seems to retain its sharpness",1
11274,I like using Front Page and find it is all that a small to mid-size company (or individual) needs,1
11275,"If your Web site needs to accommodate large databases or fast-loading pictures, you may need to upgrade to Dreamweaver or pay a professional Web designer",0
11276,"Till then, stick with Front Page and learn all you can using its tools, till you are ready to go on to the upper level courses",0
11277,"NB: An advantage that Front Page has over Publisher, is that it comes with its ""FTP"" built in",0
11278,"Good, because you don't need to get one of your own",1
11279,"Bad, because it makes it more difficult to send your Web site to someone else on disk (many elements simply don't work till they are uploaded, so you cannot send it to Aunt Sally to look at on her computer, even if she has Front Page)",-1
11280,And you do need to remind the company hosting your site to enable Front Page extensions,0
11281,"You would think that this would be part of their systems check when you upload, but for some reason, most don't bother till you call them and remind them to do so",0
11282,wonder why the developers at Microsoft are rumored to author in Homesite? things that make you go hmmmm,0
11283,If you are new to web publishing then Frontpage 2000 may be the way to go,1
11284,It does not quite offer the same level of handholding that the other Office Suite products offer (like Word),0
11285,"For example, the help file is not as complete as you would expect if you were a long time Word user",0
11286,"But if you are willing to work at it, you can become proficient at publishing fairly complex web pages",0
11287,If you want to make your website interactive then be sure you get a website host that uses the Frontpage Extensions,0
11288,"A couple of drawbacks of this software are:
1",0
11289,It crashes a lot under Win 95 (surprise) 2,-1
11290,"The web pages do not, by default, save locally automatically",-1
11291,If you are working on 5 web pages at a time you have to remember to save each one every 15 minutes due to it crashing often,-1
11292,The pages created in MS Frontpage 2000 often look different in Netscape than they do in Internet Explorer,-1
11293,"Some major pluses:
1",0
11294,It lets you manage even very complex websites with ease,1
11295,FP 2000 offers powerful management tools that let you see all your web pages in one place with all the directory structure intact,1
11296,That is a huge bonus if you have to maintain several websites and update on the fly often,1
11297,Your websites stay local and you update the entire online portion with the click of a button,1
11298,It has spellcheck,1
11299,Surf the net a bit,1
11301,It is comprehensive and will allow most novice to intermediate web designers to do what they need to do without learning a line of HTML,1
11302,"well, if you have an idea about making web pages frontpage 2000 is a big improvement over other version, hit works is for the most part stable and it does produce a nice site and fast",1
11303,if you don't have the time to make a complete site ms fp2000 does it well,0
11304,i helps to know how to edit html also,1
11305,"now if you really want to see frontpage work, upload to a server with frontpage server extensions",0
11306,"the free hosts with server extensions do not work well and you want get any support, get a dedicated server that handles fp extensions",-1
11307,"After working with web technologies and design for almost a decade, I can say that Microsoft has definitely held up the expectation of software for the non-experienced user",1
11308,FrontPage 2000 is good for people who wish to create a website of thier own and don't know the first thing about HTML or any other web programming language,1
11309,Everything with this editor is point and click as typical with any Microsoft product,1
11310,"While this editor is good for the beginner, more advanced web designers may find it difficult to work with",1
11311,"From personal experience, I have had trouble writing HTML code manually through it for more advanced functions as well as it not working well with designing Cold Fusion or PHP pages",-1
11312,"I truly like FrontPage 2000, and I *love* the fact that Microsoft recognized that all of us drones out here really do want to be able to work with the code: They've given us an HTML tab right on the page so we can toggle between editing in a WYSIWYG screen, which is all many will ever need or want, a preview screen, and an HTML screen, so we can see just WHY our tables are nesting so strangely",1
11313,"I also like the features that allow me to run mini-reports such as Recently Added Files, Recently Changed Files, and Slow Pages",1
11314,"Also a bonus: FrontPage 2000 now lets me work in layers with ""z-indexes",1
11315,""" Unforntunately, you need to realize what Netscape does to z-indexes (ignores them unless you order them numerically), and that it will chew up your pages and spit them out if you have a FrontPage form and z-indexes on a page at the same time",-1
11317,"Why can't Netscape just try to get along? I used to love Netscape, but they have made my life hell recently",-1
11318,"One drawback to FrontPage 2000: if you have a large site, its ""publishing"" feature is DEATHLY SLOW",-1
11319,And I have DSL,0
11320,"I have turned the publishing status on all pages off, and publish via FTP as I need too, and only publish those pages with forms, etc",0
11321,", that need FrontPage server extensions",0
11322,Be forewarned: your server might not like this mix-and-match routine,-1
11323,Mine always rewrites my password for some reason and I have to go back in and change it before I can post via FTP again,0
11324,I don't know if it's the server or FrontPage though,0
11325,"If you have Frontpage 98, get rid of it and buy this version",1
11326,I had Frontpage 98 and so many things are harder to do in it than it is in Frontpage 2000,1
11327,"If you are toying with the idea of trying a piece of software out to create webpages for you, this is a great one",1
11328,"However if you are new to doing webpages, you might want to read the book that comes with this so you will understand what you are doing",0
11329,"One warning and this has occurred in several areas, not many of the real neat Frontpage web objects that you can insert on your webpage will work with the ""free"" 5MB of free space your ISP provider gives you with a internet access subscription",0
11330,This even includes simple stuff like counters and navigation bars,0
11331,"I think there is a way you can get this stuff elsewhere, I just haven't tried this yet",0
11332,"However the point is, some of the whiz-bang stuff Frontpage gives you won't work on these sites",0
11333,"So if you make this real glitzy cool page before you start uploading to your website, don't be surprised when it balks and says you don't have support for these features",0
11334,"What I also liked about this product over Frontpage 98, was that the ftp interface was easier to use, one button and one address gets you where you need to go",0
11335,"Also, the new page checking mechanism with a task scheduler makes it neat to keep track of the work you are doing on each page",1
11336,I'm still not using much of the full capacity,0
11337,"However, the ease of use of this product made it real simple for me to upload a page and photos to my ISP's provided home page to sell some stuff on ebay",1
11338,That is initially all I wanted to use it for and I was struggling to do this before,1
11339,I am confident that this will also make it a whole lot easier for me to do even more complicated pages in the future,1
11340,"Since it is easy to get to the html code, I can alter that and see the results before I publish",1
11341,"The only negative is the lack of support for the neater features, I hope Microsoft would work out some of these issues so we can use all of it's capability by the next release",-1
11342,"Don't waste your money on this, while it looks appealing and can create  pages quickly, there are better alternatives available",-1
11343,Some  complaints,-1
11344,First if you decide to use themes Microsoft will allow you to  edit the HTML code and then wipe it out even if you tell it to preserve the  HTML source,-1
11345,"Another issue I have is bringing a pre-existing page into  Frontpage, I've had numerous problems with frontpage wiping out the code  and saving a bad copy",-1
11346,Save yourself the frustration and buy Macromedia's  Dreamweaver instead,-1
11347,are similar to the complaints of the other people here,0
11348,"It has a user  interface that is pretty simple and easy to pick up, but in other areas  this application falls short",2
11349,Even when viewed in Microsoft's Internet  Explorer the pages often don't look the same as they did when you were  building them in Front Page,-1
